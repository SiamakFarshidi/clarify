Importing Libraries In order to see all rows and columns we will increase max display numbers of dataframe Principal Components Analysis PCA Theory Model Theory Principal Component Analysis PCA is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data and then it projects the data onto it When faced with a large set of correlated variables principal components allow us to summarize this set with a smaller number of representative variables that collectively explain most of the variability in the original set Principal Components Analysis PCA refers to the process by which principal components are computed and the subsequent use of these components in understanding the data PCA is an unsupervised approach since it involves only a set of features X1 X2 Xp and no associated response Y Suppose that we wish to visualize n observations with measurements on a set of p features X1 X2 Xp as part of an exploratory data analysis We could do this by examining two dimensional scatterplots of the data each of which contains the n observations measurements on two of the features If p is large then it will certainly not be possible to look at all of them moreover most likely none of them will be informative since they each contain just a small fraction of the total information present in the data set In particular we would like to find a low dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible For instance if we can obtain a two dimensional representation of the data that captures most of the information then we can plot the observations in this low dimensional space There are two important outcames of PCA It reduces number of dimensions in data It shows which features explain the most variance in the data PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are as interesting as possible where the concept of interesting is measured by the amount that the observations vary along each dimension Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a linear combination of the p features The first principal component of a set of features X1 X2 Xp is the normalized linear combination of the features Screen 20Shot 202021 10 12 20at 2015 08 12 png attachment Screen 20Shot 202021 10 12 20at 2015 08 12 png that has the largest variance Since we are only interested in variance we assume that each of the variables in X has been centered to have mean zero that is the col umn means of X are zero We then look for the linear combination of the sample feature values of the form Screen

computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate FNA of a breast mass They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image It can be downloaded from here https archive ics

Vectors and Eigen Values Now we will sort EigenVectors by Eigenvalues Let s get num components of Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors Dot product of original data and eigen vectors are the principal component values This is the projection step of the original points on to the Principal Component Model For a real world example we will use Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset Features are computed from
