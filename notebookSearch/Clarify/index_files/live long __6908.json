Most What does help us to live longer or to die earlier Among hundreds of indicators in the data set let s find the most titghly bound to the life expectancy For the Life Expectancy I took Life expectancy at birth total years indicator average for both genders br For the measure of statistical relationship I took determination coefficien by countries and years no aggregation br For each of 1344 indicators available I calculated as follows 1 Filter country year value data for the life expectancy 1 Filter country year value data for the indicator being tested 1 Inner joined both by equality of country and year 1 Calculated correlation 1 Stored the indicator name as long as its correlation is at least 0 5 in absolute value See the full list in the bottom 1 TODO Perform Ridge or Lasso multi vriate analysis with test set cross validation Then I listed the indicators sorted by absolute value of correlation large to small The calculation processsing takes roughly half an hour

Roundicons Smashicons from www flaticon com http www flaticon com img Birth rate crude per 1 000 people Surprizingly and sad birth rate negatively correlates to life expectancy nearly as stron as various mortality rates see the full list in the bottom Histgram of correlations is also imressive Out of 247 countries 100 countries fit nearly perfect 80 to 100 majority of others are 50 to 80 a handful of countries have weak positive correlation below 30 there are no countries with positive moderate or strong correlation Both domain and range are wide making the tendency even more cinvincive Open questions for possible futher investigation what does make exceptional countries with moderate positive relationship for each birth rate value still there is 20 years worth gap between top and bottom What does make those different School enrollment secondary net The biggest surprise of the paper Top of the top indicators among those which cannot be attributed to sickness mortality things neither directly nor indirectly br There is a number of similar indicators fitting about the same e g different level school enrollments I will describe only this one The indicator is available for 203 countries only Out of these 110 the majority fit perfect 80 to 100 most other fit at about 75 about 20 have weak positive or negative relationship 25 to 25 few have negative correlation Gives a fresh look at the life long learning perspective br Admission level of 80 and more assures at least 65 years life expectancy nomatter is it 1970ies or2010s br And vice versa admission of 20 or less guarantees for expectancy under 65 Agriculture value added of GDP Looking at the spread width and not as good correlation I suggest this is merely a coincidence of two global trends 1 steady reduction of agriculture fractin in world GDP 1 steady increase in the worldwide average of life expectany As both are naturally changing slow they are doomed to statistically fit Relative abundance of old years dots in the lower left prompts the smaller contribution of agriculture is no guarantee for a better life expectancy br 50 of agriculture and more assures life expectancy under 55 however in recent years there is a handful of countries reaching 50 see yelow dots br On the other hand lower agriculture contribution says little expectancy can be anywhere between 40 and 75 years Combustive renewables and waste of total energy Wide spread of 45 to 75 years at almost entire domain of indicator values br Country histogram is dreadful comparable number of countries have strong negative and strong positive correlation Overall the indicator is not that definitive and mostly controversial br This is rather an artifact of several global trends coinciding Or need further investigation for the criterion to tell positivey related countries form negatively related Fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 people Graph and histogram say indicator is positively and strongly bound to the life expectancy however it is far from linear Roughly there all the countries with at least 10 phone landlines per 100 people have at least 65 years life expectancy br Less then 10 lines tell nothing can be anywhere between 40 and 80 years Interestingly enough the tendency is still there in 2010s yellow dots br Did anyone hear about the age of wireless phones Open question is it only about calling for ambulance in time Wholesale Price Index 2010 100 Correlation and country histogram look good Household final consumption expenditure per capita constant 2005 US Love is not the only thing money cannot buy you Almost anything above 3 000 per capita annually is all the same game between 70 and 80 years br Also yellow purple points in the high wage area shows it is years passing rather than wealth level that improves the result On the other hand area of under 3 000 and over 70 years is densly populated br Sort of being poor is not being condemned Please take a look below at the per country examples for how diverse the dependency is br Though country wise histogram looks good enough All Indicators Correlating at Least 50 Either positively or negatively The End Thank you for reading  Soft
