toggle list style background orange border 0 color white role tab aria controls home center Competition Overview center h2 span style color orange Description span In this competition you ll detect and delineate distinct objects of interest in biological images depicting neuronal cell types commonly used in the study of neurological disorders More specifically you ll use phase contrast microscopy images to train and test your model for instance segmentation of neuronal cells Successful models will do this with a high level of accuracy If successful you ll help further research in neurobiology thanks to the collection of robust quantitative data Researchers may be able to use this to more easily measure the effects of disease and treatment conditions on neuronal cells As a result new drugs could be discovered to treat the millions of people with these leading causes of death and disability span style color orange Evaluation Metric span This competition is evaluated on the mean average precision at different intersection over union thresholds The IoU of a proposed set of object pixels and a set of true object pixels is calculated as IoU A B A B A B The competition

750 height 500 center span style color orange What is Alzheimer s Disease span Alzheimer s disease is a progressive neurologic disorder that causes the brain to shrink atrophy and brain cells to die Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of dementia a continuous decline in thinking behavioral and social skills that affects a person s ability to function independently span style color orange What are the Key Symptoms span Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer s disease Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations As the disease progresses memory impairments worsen and other symptoms develop At first a person with Alzheimer s disease may be aware of having difficulty remembering things and organizing thoughts A family member or friend may be more likely to notice how the symptoms worsen Brain changes associated with Alzheimer s disease lead to growing trouble with Memory Thinking and Reasoning Making Judgements and Decisions Planning and Performing Familiar Tasks Changes in Personality and Behaviour Preserved Skills span style color orange What are the Causes span At a basic level brain proteins fail to function normally which disrupts the work of brain cells neurons and triggers a series of toxic events Neurons are damaged lose connections to each other and eventually die The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory but the process begins years before the first symptoms The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brains By the late stage of the disease the brain has shrunk significantly Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer s disease are focused on the role of two proteins Plaques Beta amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein When these fragments cluster together they appear to have a toxic effect on neurons and to disrupt cell to cell communication These clusters form larger deposits called amyloid plaques which also include other cellular debris Tangles Tau proteins play a part in a neuron s internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials In Alzheimer s disease tau proteins change shape and organize themselves into structures called neurofibrillary tangles The tangles disrupt the transport system and are toxic to cells span style color orange Additional

an illustration of a brain tumor jpg width 750 height 500 center span style color orange What is Brain Tumor span A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain Many different types of brain tumors exist Some brain tumors are noncancerous benign and some brain tumors are cancerous malignant Brain tumors can begin in your brain primary brain tumors or cancer can begin in other parts of your body and spread to your brain as secondary metastatic brain tumors span style color orange What are the Key Symptoms span General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include New onset or change in pattern of headaches Headaches that gradually become more frequent and more severe Unexplained nausea or vomiting Vision problems such as blurred vision double vision or loss of peripheral vision Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg Difficulty with balance Speech difficulties Feeling very tired Confusion in everyday matters Difficulty making decisions Inability to follow simple commands Personality or behavior changes Seizures especially in someone who doesn t have a history of seizures Hearing problems span style color orange What are the Causes span Primary brain tumors originate in the brain itself or in tissues close to it such as in the brain covering membranes meninges cranial nerves pituitary gland or pineal gland Primary brain tumors begin when normal cells develop changes mutations in their DNA A cell s DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do The mutations tell the cells to grow and divide rapidly and to continue living when healthy cells would die The result is a mass of abnormal cells which forms a tumor In adults primary brain tumors are much less common than are secondary brain tumors in which cancer begins elsewhere and spreads to the brain span style color orange Additional Resources for better Understanding span Brain Tumor Types Risk Factors and Symptoms Healthline Brain Tumor Symptoms

spatial dimensions so that we have a matrix of pixels by color channels Scatter plots are a go to to look for clusters and separatbility in the data but these are busy and don t reveal density well so we switch to using 2d histograms instead The data between bands is really correlated typical with visible imagery and why most satellite image analysts prefer to at least have near infrared values a
