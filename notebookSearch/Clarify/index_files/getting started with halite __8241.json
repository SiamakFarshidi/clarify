The player with the most halite at the end of the game wins In this tutorial as part of the Halite competition https www kaggle com c halite overview you ll write your own intelligent bots to play the game Note that the Halite competition is now closed so we are no longer accepting submissions That said you can still use the competition to write your own bots you just cannot submit bots to the official leaderboard To see the current list of open competitions check out the simulations homepage https www kaggle com simulations Part 1 Get started In this section you ll learn more about how to play the game Game rules In this section we ll look more closely at the game rules and explore the different icons on the game board For context we ll look at a game played by four random players You can use the animation below to view the game in detail every move is captured and can be replayed The game is played in a 21 by 21 gridworld and lasts 400 timesteps Each player starts the game with 5 000 halite and one ship Grid locations with halite are indicated by a light blue icon where larger icons indicate more available halite center img src https i imgur com 3NENMos png width 65 br center Players use ships to navigate the world and collect halite A ship can only collect halite from its current position When a ship decides to collect halite it collects 25 of the halite available in its cell This collected halite is added to the ship s cargo center img src https i imgur com eKN0kP3 png width 65 br center Halite in ship cargo is not counted towards final scores In order for halite to be counted ships need to deposit their cargo into a shipyard of the same color A ship can deposit all of its cargo in a single timestep simply by navigating to a cell containing a shipyard center img src https i imgur com LAc6fj8 png width 65 br center Players start the game with no shipyards To get a shipyard a player must convert a ship into a shipyard which costs 500 halite Also shipyards can spawn or create new ships which deducts 500 halite per ship from the player Two ships cannot successfully inhabit the same cell This event results in a collision where the ship with more halite in its cargo is destroyed and the other ship survives and instantly collects the destroyed ship s cargo center img src https i imgur com BuIUPmK png width 65 br center If you view the full game rules you ll notice that there are more types of collisions that can occur in the game for instance ships can collide with enemy shipyards which destroys the ship the ship s cargo and the enemy shipyard In general Halite is a complex game and we have not covered all of the details here But even given these simplified rules you can imagine that a successful player will have to use a relatively complicated strategy Game strategy As mentioned above a ship has two options at its disposal for collecting halite It can collect or mine halite from its current position collide with an enemy ship containing relatively more halite in its cargo In this case the ship destroys the enemy ship and steals its cargo Both are illustrated in the figure below The cargo that is tracked in the player s scoreboard contains the total cargo summed over all of the player s ships center img src https i imgur com 2DJX6Vt png width 75 br center This raises some questions that you ll have to answer when commanding ships Will your ships focus primarily on locating large halite reserves and mining them efficiently while mostly ignoring and evading the other players Or will you look for opportunities to steal halite from other players Alternatively can you use a combination of those two strategies If so what cues will you look for in the game to decide which option is best For instance if all enemy ships are far away and your ships are located on cells containing a lot of halite it makes sense to focus on mining halite Conversely if there are many ships nearby with halite to steal and not too much local halite to collect it makes sense to attack the enemy ships You ll also have to decide how to control your shipyards and how your ships interact with shipyards There are three primary actions in the game involving shipyards You can convert a ship into a shipyard This is the only way to create a shipyard use a shipyard to create a ship deposit a ship s cargo into a shipyard These are illustrated in the image below center img src https i imgur com fL5atut png width 75 br center With more ships and shipyards you can collect halite at a faster rate But each additional ship and shipyard costs you halite how will you decide when it might be beneficial to create more Part 2 Your first bot In this section you ll create your first bot to play the game The notebook The first thing to do is to create a Kaggle notebook where you ll store all of your code Begin by navigating to https www kaggle com notebooks https www kaggle com notebooks and clicking on New Notebook Next click on Create Don t change the default settings so Python should appear under Select language and you should have Notebook selected under Select type https i imgur com qUVvr8k png You now have a notebook where you ll develop your first agent If you re not sure how to use Kaggle Notebooks we strongly recommend that you walk through this notebook https www kaggle com alexisbcook getting started with titanic before proceeding It teaches you how to run code in the notebook Your first agent It s time to create your first agent Copy and paste the code in the cell below into your notebook Then run the code The line writefile submission py saves the agent to a Python file Note that all of the code above has to be copied and run in a single cell please do not split the code into multiple cells If the code cell runs successfully then you ll see a message Writing submission py or Overwriting submission py if you run it more than once Then copy and run the next code cell in your notebook to play your agent against three random agents Your agent is in the top left corner of the screen Your agent should perform much better than the random agents Note that if your ship doesn t move at all in the game then you ve likely made an error in the code you used to generate the submission py file If this is the case try copying the code cell and running it again Part 3 Keep learning This first agent is just the beginning Over time and with effort your score will gradually improve Here are some resources to keep learning The first step is to read the complete game rules https www kaggle com c halite overview environment rules For simplicity we ve only covered a subset of the rules here But you ll need a complete understanding of the game dynamics to come up with a winning strategy The agent you just submitted uses Sam Harris Halite SDK https www kaggle com sam halite sdk overview to simplify the code we need to write Check out the notebook to see what other helper functions are available Look at the Notebooks tab https www kaggle com c halite notebooks sortBy voteCount group everyone pageSize 20 competitionId 18011 in the Halite competition to learn from agents

Directions a ship can move Will keep track of whether a ship is collecting halite or carrying cargo to a shipyard Returns the commands we send to our ships and shipyards If there are no ships use first shipyard to spawn a ship If there are no shipyards convert first ship into shipyard If cargo is too low collect halite If cargo gets very big deposit halite If halite at current location running low move to the adjacent square containing the most halite Move towards shipyard to deposit cargo ", "id": "alexisbcook/getting-started-with-halite", "size": "8241", "language": "python", "html_url":
