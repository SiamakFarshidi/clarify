Country has Spikes means Zillow Estimation Inaccurate 3 2 Geographic Location by Folium and Cluster by KMeans Introduction Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet js library Manipulate your data in Python then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium Finding Most houses locat in Flat Ground Few locat in Santa Catalina Island

Estimation Never Happen in the Santa Catalina Island Millionair hard to predict 4 Time Series Approach 4 1 Aggragation Visualisation OverAll Average Absolute Log Error Los Angeles Average Absolute Log error Orange County Average Absolute Log error Ventura County Average Absolute Log error Median of Absolute Logerror Standard Deviation of Absolute Logerror Here I only use inliner Definition Absolute Logerror Mean Std Time Series Components A given time series is thought to consist of three systematic components including level trend seasonality and one non systematic component called noise These components are defined as follows 1 Level The average value in the series 2 Trend The increasing or decreasing value in the series 3 Seasonality The repeating short term cycle in the series 4 Noise The random variation in the series Combining Time Series Components A series is thought to be an aggregate or combination of these four components All series have a level and noise The trend and seasonality components are optional It is helpful to think of the components as combining either additively or multiplicatively Additive Model y t Level Trend Seasonality Noise Multiplicative Model y t Level x Trend x Seasonality x Noise Additive Model Multiplicative 4 2 Moving Average Smoothing Random Walk and Stationarity Moving average smoothing is a naive and effective technique in time series forecasting It can be used for data preparation feature engineering and even directly for making predictions A stationary time series is one where the values are not a function of time We can confirm this using a statistical significance test specifically the Augmented Dickey Fuller test The script is copied from kaggler 1 Julien Heiduk https www kaggle com zoupet and 2 https www analyticsvidhya com blog 2016 02 time series forecasting codes python 3 Dr Jason Brownlee The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non stationary and we can see that the test statistic value was 1 736474e 01 with a significance level of less than 1 i e a low probability that the result is a statistical fluke Rejecting the null hypothesis means that the process has no unit root and in turn that the time series is stationary or does not have time dependent structure Non Time Dependent Structure Under Constraint Exclude Outlier Only depend on past 3 months 4 3 Prophet Forecasting This is
