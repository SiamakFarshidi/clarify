Abstract This is dataset that describe Portugal bank marketing campaigns results Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls offering bank s clients to place a term deposit If after all marking afforts client had agreed to place deposit target variable marked yes otherwise no Sourse of the data https archive ics uci edu ml datasets bank marketing Dataset description https www kaggle com volodymyrgavrysh bank marketing campaigns data set description Citation Request This dataset is public available for research The details are described in S Moro P Cortez and P Rita A Data Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing Decision Support Systems Elsevier 62 22 31 June 2014 Task predicting the future results of marketing companies based on available statistics and accordingly formulating recommendations for such companies in the future building a profile of a consumer of banking services deposits Approach The following steps will be performed to complete the task 1 Loading data and holding a short Expanatory Data Analysis EDA 2 Formulating hypotheses regarding individual factors features for conducting correct data clearining and data preparation for modeling 3 The choice of metrics result 4 Building a pipline for Cross Validation and Grid Search procedures search for optimal parameters of the model 5 The choice of the most effective model build learninig curve rate 6 Conclusions and recomendations we intentionally use most basic machine learning models to increase the level of interprebility of the solution Feature

Yet the duration is not known before a call is performed Also after the end of the call y is obviously known Thus this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model other attributes 12 campaign number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client numeric includes last contact 13 pdays number

holding a short Expanatory Data Analysis 1 Explore categorical features EDA Primary analysis of several categorical features reveals 1 Administrative staff and technical specialists opened the deposit most of all In relative terms a high proportion of pensioners and students might be mentioned as well 2 Although in absolute terms married consumers more often agreed to the service in relative terms the single was responded better 3 Best communication channel is secullar 4 The difference is evident between consumers who already use the services of banks and received a loan 5 Home ownership does not greatly affect marketing company performance Explore numerical features EDA From correlation matrix we observe next most correlated with target feature is call duration So we need to transform it to reduce the influence higly correlated features employment rate consumer confidence index consumer price index may describe clients state from different social economic angles Their variance might support model capacity for generalization 2 Formulating hypotheses regarding individual factors features for conducting correct data clearining and data preparation for modeling Data cleaning stategy Since categorical variables dominate in dataset and the number of weakly correlated numeric variables is not more than 4 we need to transform categorical variables to increase the model s ability to generalize data we can not drop them Particular attention should be paid to the Duration Feature and categories that can be treated as binary It suggests using binning and simple transformation accordingly 0 and 1 For categories of more than 3 types of possible option marital and education it is proposed to use the encode targeting it will allow correctly relate the values to the target variable and use indicated categories in numerical form In some cases rescaling is proposed to normalize the data 3 The choice of metrics result It is proposed to use ROC AUC metrics for evaluating different models with additional monitoring of the accuracy metric dynamic This approach will allow us to explore models from different angles 4 Building a pipline for Cross Validation and Grid Search procedures search for optimal parameters of the model 5 The choice of the most effective model build learninig curve rate Best model Our best performed model with ROC AUC 0 9269 metric is Random forest This classifier could achive accuracy rate 0 903 that is average accuracy among all classifiers 0 904 We can build graph to check RandomForestClassifier performatce with OOB score to be sure that critical hyperparametr was correctly selected during Grid Search As you may see it almost the same 80 estimators with best ROC AUC score and 90 estimators with maximun of OOB score Let see the ROC AUC graph Curve is well distributed with tendency to False Positive Rate The roc auc values of the best model of 0 9269 is quite high level to make later assumptions about the data We can build feature importance of RandomForestClassifier with best ROC AUC score 6 Conclusions and recomendations What general recommendations can be offered for a successful marketing company in the future This analysis can be carried out at the level of individual bank branches as does not require much resources and special knowledge the model itself can be launched automatically with a certain periodicity Potentially similar micro targeting will increase the overall effectiveness of the entire marketing company 1 Take into account the time of the company May is the most effective 2 Increase the time of contact with customers perhaps in a different way formulating the goal of the company It is possible to use other means of communication 3 Focus on specific categories The model shows that students and senior citizens respond better to proposal 4 It is imperative to form target groups based on socio economic categories Age income level not always high profession can accurately determine the marketing profile of a potential client Given these factors it is recommended to concentrate on those consumer groups that are potentially more promising The concentration of the bank s efforts will effectively distribute the company s resources to the main factor the bank s contact time with the client it affects most of all on conversion The continuation of such a study may be the formation of a clear customer profile by age gender income and other factors as well as the adaptation of the product itself deposit for a specific category of consumer Thank you for your time Feel free to conctact https www linkedin com in volodymyrgavrish  Import libraries Read data Build a function to show categorical values disribution temp df count categorical values Convert target variable into
