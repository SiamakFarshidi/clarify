abnormalities on chest radiographs br This is an object detection and classification problem For each test image you will be predicting a bounding box and class for all findings If you predict that there are no findings you should create a prediction of none 1 0 0 1 1 none is the class ID for no finding and this provides a one pixel bounding box with a confidence of 1 0 Further for each test study you should make a determination within the following labels Negative for Pneumonia Typical Appearance Indeterminate Appearance Atypical Appearance To make a prediction of one of the above labels create a prediction string similar to the none class above i e atypical 1 0 0 1 1 MESSAGE FROM THE COMPETITION HOST ON LABEL AND BBOX DETAILS In this challenge the chest radiographs CXRs were categorized using a specific grading schema based on a published paper Litmanovich DE Chung M Kirkbride RR Kicska G Kanne JP Review of chest radiograph findings of COVID 19 pneumonia and suggested reporting language Journal of thoracic imaging 2020 Nov 14 35 6 354 60 https journals lww com thoracicimaging Fulltext 2020 11000 Review of Chest Radiograph Findings of COVID 19 4 aspx Per the grading schema chest radiographs are classified into one of four categories which are mutually exclusive 1 Typical Appearance Multifocal bilateral peripheral opacities with rounded morphology lower lung predominant distribution 2 Indeterminate Appearance Absence of typical findings AND unilateral central or upper lung predominant distribution 3 Atypical Appearance Pneumothorax pleural effusion pulmonary edema lobar consolidation solitary lung nodule or mass diffuse tiny nodules cavity 4 Negative for Pneumonia No lung opacities Bounding boxes were placed on lung opacities whether typical or indeterminate Bounding boxes were also placed on some atypical findings including solitary lobar consolidation nodules masses and cavities Bounding boxes were not placed on pleural effusions or pneumothoraces No bounding boxes were placed for the negative for pneumonia category In cases of multiple adjacent opacities we opted for one large bounding box rather than multiple adjacent smaller boxes to improve consistency in the labeling Annotators did have access to the COVID status for each patient but were asked to adhere to the grading system above irrespective of the status As such some patients who were COVID negative still had chest radiographs with typical appearances Similarly some patients who were COVID positive had atypical appearances or were negative for pneumonia no lung opacities because the grading system is based off the chest radiographic findings alone The goal in this challenge is to determine the appropriate category for each radiograph as well as localize the lung opacities with a bounding box prediction The images are in DICOM format which means they contain additional data that might be useful for visualizing and classifying Note that the images are in DICOM format which means they contain additional data that might be useful for visualizing and classifying Example Radiographs https i imgur com QWmbhXx png br b style text decoration underline font family Verdana DATASET INFORMATION b The train dataset comprises 6 334 chest scans in DICOM format which were de identified to protect patient privacy Note that all images are stored in paths with the form study series image The study ID here relates directly to the study level predictions the image ID is the ID used for image level predictions The test dataset is of roughly the same scale as the training dataset As this is a kernels only competition we shsould plan accordingly i e we should be able to infer on the entirety of the training dataset within the submission kernel br b style

identify and localize COVID 19 abnormalities on chest radiographs In particular you ll categorize the radiographs as one of a possible 4 categories In this competition we are making predictions at both a study multi image and image level negative for pneumonia or typical indeterminate or atypical You ll work with a dataset consisting of 8 781 scans that have been annotated by experienced radiologists You can train your model with 6 334 independently labeled images and you will be evaluated on a test set of 2 447 images The challenge uses the standard PASCAL VOC 2010 mean Average Precision mAP at IoU 0 5 Note that the linked document describes VOC 2012 which differs in some minor ways e g there is no concept of difficult classes in VOC 2010 The P R curve and AP calculations remain the same br center center center font color red b If successful you ll help radiologists diagnose the millions of COVID 19 patients more confidently and quickly b font center center center br
