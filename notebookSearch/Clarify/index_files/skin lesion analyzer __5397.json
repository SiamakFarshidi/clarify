primarily diagnosed visually beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis a biopsy and histopathological examination Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions This the HAM10000 Human Against Machine with 10000 training images dataset It consists of 10015 dermatoscopicimages which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publiclyavailable through the ISIC archive This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below 1 Melanocytic nevi 2 Melanoma 3 Benign keratosis like lesions 4 Basal cell carcinoma 5 Actinic keratoses 6 Vascular lesions 7 Dermatofibroma Objective Create an online tool that can tell doctors and lab technologists the three highest probability diagnoses for a given skin lesion This will help them quickly identify high priority patients and speed up their workflow The app should produce a result in less than 3 seconds To ensure privacy the images must be pre processed and analysed locally and never be uploaded to an external server LABELS 1 Melanocytic nevi nv Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes and appear in a myriad of variants which all are included in our series The variants may differ significantly from a dermatoscopic point of view 6705 images 2 Melanoma mel Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision Melanomas can be invasive or non invasive in situ We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ but did exclude non pigmented subungual ocular or mucosal melanoma 1113 images 3 Benign keratosis like lesions bkl Benign keratosis is a generic class that includes seborrheic ker atoses senile wart solar lentigo which can be regarded a flat variant of seborrheic keratosis and lichen planus like keratoses LPLK which corresponds to a seborrheic keratosis or a solar lentigo with inflammation and regression 22 The three subgroups may look different dermatoscop ically but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic term histopathologically From a dermatoscopic view lichen planus like keratoses are especially challeng ing because they can show morphologic features mimicking melanoma 23 and are often biopsied or excised for diagnostic reasons 1099 images 4 Basal cell carcinoma bcc Basal cell carcinoma is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes but grows destructively if untreated It appears in different morphologic variants flat nodular pigmented cystic etc 21 which are all included in this set 514 images 5 Actinic keratoses akiec Actinic Keratoses Solar Keratoses and intraepithelial Carcinoma Bowen s disease are common non invasive variants of squamous cell car cinoma that can be treated locally without surgery Some authors regard them as precursors of squamous cell carcinomas and not as actual carci nomas There is however agreement that these lesions may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma which is usually not pigmented Both neoplasms commonly show surface scaling and commonly are devoid of pigment Actinic keratoses are more common on the face and Bowen s disease is more common on other body sites Because both types are in duced by UV light the surrounding skin is usually typified by severe sun damaged except in cases of Bowen s disease that are caused by human papilloma virus infection and not by UV Pigmented variants exists for Bowen s disease 19 and for actinic keratoses 20 Both are included in this set 327 images 6 Vascular lesions vasc Vascular skin lesions in the dataset range from cherry angiomas to angiokeratomas 25 and pyogenic granulomas 26 Hemorrhage is also included in this category 142 images 7 Dermatofibrom df Dermatofibroma is a benign skin lesion regarded as either a benign proliferation or an inflammatory reaction to minimal trauma It is brown often showing a central zone of fibrosis dermatoscopically 24 115 images Total images 10015 Create a directory structure Data Exploration This graph shows the dataset has a major problem of class imbalance Splitting data into training and validation sets Transfer the images into the folders Image augumentation Visualizing the images Set up the generators Modifying the MobileNet model Training the Model Plotting the training curves The validation set results are greater than training set because when training a percentage of the features are set to zero 25 in this case as I m using Dropout 0 25 When testing all features are used and are scaled appropriately So the model at test time is more robust and can lead to higher testing accuracies
