works good on LB I got 0 210 score h4 Conclusion ", "stargazers_count": 0, "forks_count": 0, "description": "This kernel is specifically is for Beginners who want s to experiment building CNN using Keras By using this kernel you can expect to get good score and also learn keras Keras is simple frameworks where we can initialize the model and keep stacking the layers we want It makes building deep neural networks very easy Intro about the Data Sentinet 1 sat is at about 680 Km above earth Sending pulses of signals at a particular angle of incidence and then recoding it back Basically those reflected signals are called backscatter The data we have been given is backscatter coefficient which is the conventional form of backscatter coefficient given by \u03c3o dB \u03b2o dB 10log10 sin ip sin ic where 1 ip is angle of incidence for a particular pixel 2 ic is angle of incidence for center of the image 3 K constant We have been given \u03c3o directly in the data Now coming to the features of \u03c3o Basically \u03c3o varies with the surface on which the signal is scattered from For example for a particular angle of incidence it varies like WATER SETTLEMENTS AGRICULTURE BARREN 1 HH 27 001 2 70252 12 7952 17 25790909 2 HV 28 035 20 2665 21 4471 20 019 As you can see the HH component varies a lot but HV doesn t I don t have the data for scatter from ship but being a metal object it should vary differently as compared to ice object WTF is HH HV Ok so this Sentinal Settalite is equivalent to RISTSAT an Indian remote sensing Sat and they only Transmit pings in H polarization AND NOT IN V polarization Those H pings gets scattered objects change their polarization and returns as a mix of H and V Since Sentinel has only H transmitter return signals are of the form of HH and HV only Don t ask why VV is not given because Sentinel don t have V ping transmitter Now coming to features for the purpose of this demo code I am extracting all two bands and taking avg of them as 3rd channel to create a 3 channel RGB equivalent That s a cool looking iceberg we have Remember in radar data the shape of the iceberg is going to be like a mountain as shown in here Since this is not a actual image but scatter from radar the shape is going to have peaks and distortions like these The shape of the ship is going to be like a point may be like a elongated point From here the structural differences arise and we can exploit those differences using a CNN It would be helpful if we can create composite images using the backscatter from radar That s a ship looks like a elongated point We don t have much resolution in images to visualize the shape of the ship However CNN is here to help There are few papers on ship iceberg classification like this http elib dlr de 99079 2 2016 BENTES Frost Velotto Tings EUSAR FP pdf However their data have much better resolution so I don t feel that the CNN they used would be suitable here Get back to building a CNN using Keras Much better frameworks then others You will enjoy for sure Though the score may be different here it works good on LB I got 0 210 score Conclusion To increase the score I have tried Speckle filtering Indicence angle normalization and other preprocessing and they don t seems to work You may try and see but for me they are not giving any good results You can t be on top 10 using this kernel so here is one beautiful peice of information The test dataset contain 8000 images We can exploit this We can do pseudo labelling to increase the predictions Here is the article related to that https towardsdatascience com simple explanation of semi supervised learning and pseudo labeling c2218e8c769b Upvote if you liked this kernel  This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed It is defined by the kaggle python docker image https github com kaggle docker python For example here s several helpful packages to load in linear algebra data processing CSV file I O e g pd read csv Input data files are available in the input directory For example running this by clicking run or pressing Shift Enter will list the files in the input directory Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output Load the data Generate the training data Create 3 bands having HH HV and avg of both Take a look at a iceberg Import Keras define our model Building
