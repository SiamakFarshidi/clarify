Themain aim of thesurvey was to assess thestock of mussel bedsin Belfast Lough and to surveytheCrepidulapopulation in Belfast Lough.The infaunal surveying was carried out using a 0.1m2 day grab and a 1mm sieve. Sampleswere taken at 50 stationsover 5 days in September in 2012- abundance & biomasswere recorded and infauna were identified to species level where possible. Particle size analysis & Carbonand Nitrogen analysis was also carried out at each station.The most abundant species found and most frequentlyrecorded was the polychaete Melinnapalmata."], "datePublished": ["2021-12-02"], "language": ["en"], "creator": ["\u00c2\u00a0Agri-Food and BiosciencesInstitute- Sean Briggs "], "metadataProvider": ["\u00c2\u00a0Flanders Marine Institute(VLIZ) BEhttps://www.vliz.be"], "contact": ["\u00c2\u00a0Agri-Food and BiosciencesInstitute- Matt Service "], "associatedParty": [" contentProvider\u00c2\u00a0Marine Biological Association of theUK GB "], "licenseInformation": [" Intellectual Rights This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License .\u00c2\u00a0 "], "downloadLink": ["https://metadatacatalogue.lifewatch.eu:/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/oai:marineinfo.org:id:dataset:6187"], "keywords": ["N/A"], "geographicCoverage": ["Geographic Description ANE, IrishSea"], "westBoundingCoordinate": ["-5.893016666667"], "eastBoundingCoordinate": ["-5.651333333333"], "northBoundingCoordinate": ["54.727333333333"], "southBoundingCoordinate": ["54.638566666667"], "dateCreated": ["2012-09-06"], "temporalCoverageEndDate": ["2012-09-23"], "license": ["N/A"], "distribution": ["N/A"], "distributionInfo": ["N/A"], "identifier": ["https://metadatacatalogue.lifewatch.eu:/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/oai:marineinfo.org:id:dataset:6187"], "accessibilitySummary": ["N/A"], "version": ["N/A"], "temporalCoverage": ["N/A"], "publisher": ["N/A"], "spatial": ["N/A"], "citation": ["N/A"], "genre": ["N/A"], "modificationDate": ["2021-12-02"], "image": ["N/A"], "thumbnailUrl": ["N/A"], "headline": ["Abundance & Biomass of benthic infauna from grab samples taken as part of an ecosystem assessment of Belfast Lough in 2012"], "abstract": ["This dataset contains information on the abundance & biomass ofinfauna found in sediment grab samples carried out in Belfast Lough as part of a mussel(Mytilus edulis) bed stock assessment and Crepidula(Crepidula fornicata) survey in September 2012.
