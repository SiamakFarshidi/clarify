The researcher will be affiliated with the naXys research institute in Namur, but will spend 20% of his/her time at the ICTEAM/INMA institute in Louvain-la-Neuve. The goal of the Kornet project is to leverage Koopman operator theory in the context of nonlinear network identification. In particular, the selected candidate will develop a modular Koopman operator-based representation of interconnected dynamical systems, which preserves and exploits network structure.EnvironmentThe University of Namur (UNamur) is located in the center of Belgium, in the French-speaking part of the country. It offers quality education to more than 7,000 students every year, and hosts more than 900 researchers in all fields of expertise. More info: https://www.unamur.be/en/institution/index The naXys institute brings together 25 professors and more than 50 researchers working on complex systems in a broad sense, including systems theory, network science, graph theory, control theory, statistics, optimization, and applications to celestial mechanics, cosmology, economics, and optical engineering, to list a few. More info: https://www.naxys.beProfileThe candidate must hold a PhD degree in Mathematics or Control Engineering (or equivalent). He/she is expected to have a solid background in Applied Mathematics, with a keen interest in learning theoretical concepts but also in developing practical methodologies for applications. Specific knowledge of operator theory, networked dynamics, control theory, and/or system identification will be appreciated. Past research work in Koopman operator theory will be considered as a plus.To be eligible, the candidate must have a PhD degree for 6 years maximum at the beginning of the postdoctoral fellowship and must not have resided or carried out his/her main activity (job, studies..) in Belgium for more than 24 months during the last 3 years.Additional information\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Expected start date: February 1st \u00e2\u0080\u0093 July 1st 2022\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Duration: 1 year (possibly renewable for 1 year)\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Contact persons: Prof. A.
