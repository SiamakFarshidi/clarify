SSD significantly affects cortical symmetry, as it results in an increased dominant representation of the normal ear compared to the deaf ear. Research shows that early intervention in children with SSD can restore the hemispheric representations of bilateral auditory input in the auditory cortex. Using EEG-based objective measures, we will investigate the binaural restoration at the subcortical and cortical level of the auditory pathway in children who are four years and older. Neural activity captured by the multi-channel EEG will be used to construct functional network models of cortical processes.This position is a part of the H2020 Marie-Curie Innovative Training Network project Comm4CHILD (https://comm4child.ulb.be) that received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 860755.Your profileMaster degree in audiology, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, psychology, or related fieldProfound interest in scienceExperience with electrophysiological data is an assetGood verbal skills Dutch (for the children) is an assetGood verbal and written communication skills in EnglishKeen interest in signal processing (CI, artefacts), statistics (R), matlab,Keen interest to (learn to) work with the neuroimaging toolbox BrainstormInterested to learn within an international network, spend secondments in a partner country, attend network-wide training events and conferencesEligibility criteria:The candidate must have resided or carried out their main activity in a different country from the host organization for at least 12 months prior to their recruitment.
