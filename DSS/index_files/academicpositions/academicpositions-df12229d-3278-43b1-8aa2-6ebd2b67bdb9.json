He is one of the Hector Fellows, a community of outstanding professors from different research institutions across Germany working in <strong>STEM-subjects</strong>, <strong>medicine</strong>, and <strong>psychology</strong>.</p><p>He is one of the world's leading experts on the mechanisms of gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. He resolved the three-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase II, discovered mechanisms underlying gene regulation at the origin of genes and developed methods to track the metabolism of mRNA in cells. More recently, he is working on the development of methods to visualize and functionally analyze the transcription of a natural DNA template called chromatin.</p><p><br/><strong>Your profile</strong></p><p>You are enthusiastic about developing and investigating an innovative research idea within <a href=\"https://www.hector-fellow-academy.de/en/hector-fellows/profile/patrick-cramer\" target=\"_blank\">the discipline of Prof. Cramer.\u00a0</a><br/>You have a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in a scientific or engineering subject with excellent grades.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Our offer</strong></p><ul><li>Opportunity to realize a self-developed research idea</li><li>Mentored by an internationally renowned, top-level scientist</li><li>Funded position (according to TV-L 13, up to 100%, based on the <a href=\"http://www.dfg.de/formulare/55_02/55_02_de.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">funding rates</a> of the DFG for PhD students)</li><li>Extensive research funding</li><li>Membership in an excellent research network</li><li>Additional management courses, trainings &amp; networking events</li></ul><p><strong>Your application</strong></p><p>Apply until <strong>March 31st, 2022</strong>\u00a0 via our <a href=\"https://hectorfellowacademy.applicationportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Application Portal</a>.</p><p>Further information: <a href=\"http://www.hector-fellow-academy.de/en/phd-students.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.hector-fellow-academy.de</a></p>\n</div>", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "N/A", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiI1ZmFcL2I0YVwvNWZhYjRhMTZkNmI2MTBkZGQxMTNlZjdhODEyYWMxNTYucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
