BECOME PART OF SILICON AUSTRIA LABSSilicon Austria Labs is performing cutting-edge research in the course of the 6G Lighthouse on the physical layer of RF systems for future 5G/-6G (UE, front and backhaul), and millimeter-wave and sub- Terahertz imaging/-sensing/-radar applications. In this domain, the Research Unit for Millimeter Wave Technologies collaborates closely with university and leading industry partners on e.g. RF/ millimeter-wave transceiver architectures robust in terms of interference and coexistence, reconfigurable RF systems for transceivers and RF/-millimeter-wave front-end modules (architectural reuse and/ or resource sharing), and large-scale phased-array antennas and beamforming structures, which are targeting millimeter-wave and sub-Terahertz communications (5G, 6G), radars and imagers. In support of the design activities the mmWave RF Unit is equipped with the best in-class test infrastructure covering the GHz and THz frequency range.The top research center for electronic based systems (EBS).
