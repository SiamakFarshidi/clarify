Strong research and attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.Research and graduate education at the Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology comprises a wide scientific breadth from the atomic and molecular level all the way through to cells and intact organisms. Many of the phenomena we study impact on our natural environment and living systems. We participate in undergraduate programs in chemistry, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, biology, marine sciences, and pharmacy.The successful applicant will be part of the research group of Gisela Br\u00c3\u00a4nd\u00c3\u00a9n at the University of Gothenburg. In the research group, we use innovative biochemical and biophysical methods to study the structure, dynamics and function of proteins. We drive methods development within serial crystallography, both for time-resolved studies of proteins at work, and for future use within pharmaceutical drug design. More information about the research group can be found at www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/giselabrandenThe Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology now seeks applicants for a PhD position focusing on structural biology, specifically how serial crystallography can be used in pharmaceutical compound screening. This position will involve close collaboration with AstraZeneca, the MAX IV Laboratory in Lund and other X-ray facilities in Europe.Job assignmentsThe PhD student will be part of a larger constellation of Swedish and German research groups in a project financed by a Swedish Research Council Rontgen-Angstrom Cluster grant where the goal is to further develop the method serial crystallography for use within drug discovery. The candidate will use biochemical methods to express and purify proteins. The main focus will be on protein crystallization, binding of pharmaceutical compounds, and data analysis for structure based drug design. The PhD student will also be involved in the design of new experimental set ups for X-ray diffraction data collection at synchrotron facilities.The student is also expected to acquire 60 hp through PhD level courses, some of which are mandatory, and to help with the teaching of laboratory exercises that are part of undergraduate courses.EligibilityTo be eligible for third-cycle studies, the applicant must meet both the general and specific entry requirements: A person meets the general entry requirements for third-cycle courses and study programs if he or she:has been awarded a second-cycle qualification,has satisfied the requirements for courses comprising at least 240 credits of which at least 60 credits were awarded in the second-cycle, orhas acquired substantially equivalent knowledge in some other way in Sweden or abroad.To meet the specific entry requirements for third-cycle studies, applicants must: (i) have a second-cycle (advanced-level) degree in a relevant* subject area in the natural sciences, or (ii) have completed studies for at least 60 higher education credits at a second-cycle level in relevant subject areas in the natural sciences, or (iii) have completed a corresponding program of relevance to the planned third-cycle program, in Sweden or in another country, or have equivalent qualifications.*Relevant for the planned third-cycle educationThe specific entry requirements also include an acceptable command of spoken and written English. Guidelines for assessing English proficiency may include a minimum score of 550 on the TOEFL test (or 213 on the TOEFL-CBT, or 79 on the TOEFL-iBT).AssessmentThe candidate is expected to collaborate well with other scientists within a larger team and have high quality communication skills. It is of great importance that the applicant can work independently, has the willingness to learn new skills and is fluent in English, both in speech and in writing. Experience in biochemical and biophysical methods is a merit, as well as previous experience in X-ray crystallography.In selecting between applicants who meet the general and specific entry requirements, their ability to benefit from third-cycle studies shall be taken into account. The assessment shall attach particular importance to documented qualifications for:- specific knowledge and skills within the subject area and related research fields&nbsp;- experience of scientific theory and relevant research methodology&nbsp;- scientific analysis and presentation verified through thesis, degree project, scientific journals or the like.EmploymentType of employment: Fixed-term employment, four years full timeExtent: 100 %Location: Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, GothenburgFirst day of employment: As soon as possible based on agreementRegulations for the evaluation of qualifications for education on a doctoral level are given in SFS 1993:100.A new employment as a PhD student applies for a maximum of one year. The Appointment may be prolonged for up to two years at a time. The total employment period may not be longer than the equivalent of four years of full time doctoral studies.University applies local agreement on salaries of graduate students.For further information regarding the positionGisela Br\u00c3\u00a4nd\u00c3\u00a9n, Associate Professorgisela.branden@gu.seUnionsUnion representatives at the University of Gothenburg:https://www.gu.se/en/about-the-university/work-at-the-university-of-gothenburg/how-to-applyInformation for International ApplicantsChoosing a career in a foreign country is a big step.
