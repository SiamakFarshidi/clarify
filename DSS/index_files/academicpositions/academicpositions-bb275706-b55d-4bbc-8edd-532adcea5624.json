A \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3,000 annual package for travels and equipment will be allotted.Research project (1/2 page \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1 page)The aim of the postdoc project is to document the potential of Lithium isotopes to identify living water environments of extant and extinct vertebrates, and to understand the origin of the factors that control Li isotope fractionation and Li transfers within different past and present vertebrates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a representative number of analyses, the candidate will investigate whether this proxy based on Li isotopes can be applied to all vertebrate groups such as bony fishes, sharks, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Bone and tooth samples of extant species living in contrasted environments (marine, brackish, fresh) are available for analysis. The ultimate goal is to establish a precise proxy to the vertebrate living environment based on the combined use of Li, O and S stable isotopes that can be applied to the fossil record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The established proxy will then be tested on Miocene vertebrates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bones and teeth from the Falun deposits, where marine and continental species are found in association. These samples are already on our procession and their \u00ce\u00b418O values have been published.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on the results, the candidate will then focus on one of the main questions of vertebrates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ecological transition: the Devonian terrestrialization of tetrapods. He/she will use bones samples from Devonian tetrapods, already in our possession and previously analysed for their \u00ce\u00b418O and \u00ce\u00b434S values that revealed the freshwater or seawater influence on the living environment of the Devonian tetrapod species. Li isotopes will allow to refine previous conclusions by specifying the species that live in transitional environments.&nbsp;Research field(s)Geochemistry, Paleo-ecology, paleo-environmentSupervisor and contactName: Romain AmiotLaboratory: Laboratoire de G\u00c3\u00a9ologie de Lyon, Terre, Plan\u00c3\u00a8tes, environnement, UMR 5276.

It is one of 12 LabExes supported by the University of Lyon community of universities and establishments (COMUE). LIO brings together more than 200 elite researchers recruited throughout the word and forming 18 research teams from four laboratories in the Rh\u00c3\u00b4ne-Alps region, all leaders in their fields, under the auspices of the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL), the Ecole Normale Sup\u00c3\u00a9rieure de Lyon, and the CNRS. LIO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to explore questions about our origins, operating in a broad field of study that ranges from particle physics to geophysics, and includes cosmology, astrophysics, planetology and life.Selection processQualifications / Skills / Education &amp; Research requirementsThe candidate must hold a PhD and have previous experience in the clean lab and measuring isotope ratios on various mass spectrometers. Experience in non-traditional isotope systems would be a plus. Because of existing cross-disciplinary bridges, we will also consider candidates with a background in isotopic ecology. Finally, fieldwork and museum visits to collect samples are also to be considered in the frame of the project.Application deadlineApril the 1st, 2022Requested documents for applicationApplicants must email a CV, a statement of interest, a&nbsp;letter of recommendation and contact details for 2-3 references&nbsp;romain.amiot@univ-lyon1.fr before April the 1st, 2022.&nbsp;Candidates on the short list will be informed by the end of April.
