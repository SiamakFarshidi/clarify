Better insight in how to optimize and/or control project performance is essential both from an efficiency and an effectivity viewpoint. This requires state of the art management systems which make it possible to improve managerial decisions within different phases of civil engineering projects (design, construct, procurement, planning, etc.).</p> <p>Possible research themes are:</p> <ul> <li>Researching project management complexity with a fit-for-purpose approach (topics: agile/flexible/adaptive/fit for purpose project management systems, risk management, modular and/or lean construction concepts as a way to improve circularity and/or productivity in the construction industry, learning from projects);</li> <li>Studying collaborative (contract) relations for an integral design approach (topics: project management systems where human behavior is properly reflected, supply chain decision tools);</li> <li>Integrated (multi-actor) design/project decision-making based upon project data streams (topic: integrated multi-stakeholder design optimization tools).</li> </ul> <p>For these topics to be further researched, both fundamental and theoretical knowledge and reflective practical experience with project management in the industry (civil, mechanical as well as process engineering and construction) are necessary and integrative attributes.
