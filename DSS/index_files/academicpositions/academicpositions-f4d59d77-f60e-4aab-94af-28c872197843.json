The project is aimed at unraveling how chromosomal sex and hormonal influences regulate sex differences in adipose tissue function. Sex-specific cell lines for white and brown adipocytes are currently a limiting factor. In this project, you will develop novel adipocyte models using patient-derived iPS cells to study sex differences in adipose tissue function. You will use your knowledge and experience in stem cell biology, cell model development, and gene editing technology to generate models for several human diseases of metabolic disorders, including genetic obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, and disorders of sex differentiation.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n    For this position we are seeking a highly motivated PhD candidate with a PhD degree in Biology, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, Medicine or other related fields, and with less than five year experience as post-doctoral fellow.
