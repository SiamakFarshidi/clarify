Will you decide to run as fast as possible to catch the first incoming bus? Or maybe you are tired and will prefer to walk slowly to save your energy, at the risk of missing this first bus and arriving late at home? This example illustrates that our daily decisions and actions involve some kind of economic computation in which we adjust effort to obtain reward (here arriving comfortably at home) sooner than later. While the impact of reward on decision making and its underlying neural bases have been extensively studied, much less is known regarding how effort and time affect reward-related decisions and movements. The goal of this proposal is to take advantage of the foraging theory to test the hypothesis that individual sensitivites to time and effort drive variability in the strategy of rats facing an explore vs exploit dilemna. Such knowledge may help to understand what conditions favor seemingly irrational or non optimal human behavior.&nbsp;QUALIFICATIONS/SKILLS/EDUCATION &amp; RESEARCH REQUIREMENTSWe are looking for a candidate with an engineer/physicist profile, capable of developing numerical simulation, modeling (i.e. strong programing skills) and with a strong taste for animal behavior and cognition&nbsp;APPLICATION DEADLINEFebruary 16, 2022&nbsp;STARTING DATEOctober 2022&nbsp;JOB LOCATIONAix Marseille University at the Luminy Campus - Marseille&nbsp;REQUESTED DOCUMENTS OF APPLICATIONApplication must include:CVcover letterAn email will be automatically sent to your two references in order for them to upload their recommendation letter directly.
