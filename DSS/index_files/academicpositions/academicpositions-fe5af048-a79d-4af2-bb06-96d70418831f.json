The smaller the size, the higher the risk posed to organisms and human health. Do you want to contribute to new insights into this topic by using cutting-edge research? Then you have a part to play as a PhD candidate. You will use fate modelling to predict pharmaceutical concentrations in European river basins, and afterwards put the model into practice in the actual river basins.<br><br></em>The EU LABPLAS project is a project in which 16 European research organisations cooperate to develop new techniques and models for the quantification of microplastics. The project aims to develop practical computational tools to facilitate the mapping of plastic-impacted hotspots and promote scientifically sound plastic governance. One of such tools is a source-to-ocean model that will provide the basis for a European PLastic informAtion System (ePLAS).</p> <p>As a PhD candidate, you will work on the adaptation of an existing fate model that is used to predict pharmaceutical concentrations in European river basins. You will expand this model with: (1) spatially-explicit approaches to estimate the source strength of different categories of microplastics, and (2) model equations to model source-to-ocean transport of microplastics at the river basin scale. The updated model will initially be developed and tested on the basis of a case study focusing on the Elbe river basin (Central Europe), and then validated and further refined based on case studies focusing on the Thames (UK) and Mero-Barc\u00e9s (Spain) river basins. The case studies will provide insight into the processes and parameters relevant to model the emission and source-to-sea transport of microplastics at the European scale. In your work, you will collaborate with researchers from various European research organisations (e.g. from the University of Ghent, Belgium, and the University of Vigo, Spain). You will be supervised by researchers from Radboud University in Nijmegen (Netherlands) and the Open University in Heerlen (Netherlands). You will participate actively in several BSc courses on environmental modelling and risk assessment, and be involved in the supervision of BSc and MSc students. You will have a teaching load of up to 10%.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<ul>\n<li>You should hold an MSc in one of the environmental, natural or engineering sciences, in which you preferably acquired knowledge of environmental chemistry or physics.</li>\n<li>You have computer modelling skills, preferably in R.</li>\n<li>You have experience with gathering and extracting data from public sources.</li>\n<li>You\u00c2\u00a0have affinity with data analysis, data interpretation and spatial data modelling (e.g. GIS).</li>\n<li>You should have analytical skills, ambition, and communication and collaborative skills (particularly a good command of oral and written English).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>", "conditions_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Conditions of employment</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Fixed-term</strong> contract: You will be employed for an initial period of 18 months, after which your performance will be evaluated.
