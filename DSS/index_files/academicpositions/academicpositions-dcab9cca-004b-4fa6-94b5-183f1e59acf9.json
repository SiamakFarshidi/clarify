To help organisations progress in these areas, we need more insights into the origin and development of gender knowledge. As a PhD candidate, your cutting-edge research into gender knowledge in international organisations can help us better understand and facilitate successful gender mainstreaming.</em></p> As a PhD candidate, you will carry out research on gender knowledge creation and contestation in international organisations. Focusing on the International Labour Organization (ILO), it will be of particular interest to determine the pathways of and the causes for the emergence of gender knowledge as well as conflictual or consensual processes associated with it. Given that gender knowledge forms the basis of gender mainstreaming policies adopted by both national and international bureaucracies, learning about its origin is crucial to understand and facilitate successful gender mainstreaming. The project is based on a qualitative research design and involves field research in Geneva, archival research, document analysis and conducting interviews. It is also closely linked to the research hotspot '<a href=\"https://www.ru.nl/nsm/imr/our-research/hot-spots/gender-power-politics-management/\">Gender and Power in Politics and Management</a>', which both PhD supervisors are affiliated with and which offers researchers from different disciplines a platform for exchange, collaboration and exchange.\u00a0<br>You will be responsible for carrying out the core of the data collection and analysis for this project, which will include travelling to conduct semi-structure interviews and collect documents at the International Labour Organization in Geneva. In addition, you will be expected to co-author publications in which the project findings are reported and individually report on your own research in highly-regarded academic journals and in the form of a PhD manuscript. Research findings will also be presented at international and national academic conferences. At different points throughout the project, you will have the opportunity to engage in knowledge valorisation activities, such as briefings to policymakers. Supervision will be provided by Dr Inge Bleijenbergh (Department of Business Administration) and Dr Jutta Joachim (Department of Political Science) who will jointly act as PhD supervisors.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<ul>\n<li>You have a Master's degree in one of the social sciences such as political science/international relations, public/business administration or sociology (or a related discipline).</li>\n<li>You have excellent research skills, and knowledge of and experience with conducting qualitative interviews, archival research and qualitative content analysis.</li>\n<li>You are fluent in English and French, and have excellent academic writing skills in English.</li>\n<li>You are able to work independently as well as in a team.</li>\n<li>You have good organisational and project management skills.</li>\n<li>Particular knowledge of and experience in organisational and gender studies is a plus.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>", "conditions_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Conditions of employment</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Fixed-term</strong> contract: You will be employed for an initial period of 18 months, after which your performance will be evaluated.
