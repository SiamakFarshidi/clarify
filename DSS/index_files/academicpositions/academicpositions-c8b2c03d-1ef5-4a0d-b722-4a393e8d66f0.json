Using hundreds of isogenic cell lines with loss and gain of function for each human solute carrier transporter, we obtained metabolomic/ionomic, transcriptomic and proteomic large-scale data sets annotated with subcellular localization. You will validate biochemically and functionally the most intriguing findings of the large-scale transporter interactome and work in the Giulio Superti-Furga group (CeMM, Vienna) in close collaboration with other project and data scientists. Together we want to bring knowledge on human transporters to the next level by turning data into biological insights.</p><h2><strong>Requirements and desired qualifications\u00a0</strong></h2><ul><li>PhD in molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry or similar</li><li>Profound knowledge in mammalian cell biology</li><li>Experience in site-directed mutagenesis and with CRISPR/Cas9 technologies</li><li>Experience in mammalian cell culture and viral delivery systems</li><li>Experience in validation technologies such as IF, WB, IP-MS</li><li>Proven publication track record</li><li>Inclination to work in a team is important and a proactive attitude required</li><li>Excellent written / oral communication skills in English</li></ul><h2><strong>The RESOLUTE Consortium</strong></h2><p>Starting on July 1st of 2018, the RESOLUTE consortium is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI, www.imi.europa.eu) with 13 partners from academia and the pharmaceutical industry and is coordinated by the Superti-Furga laboratory. The RESOLUTE consortium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to de-orphanize human SLC transporters at a large scale and unlock them as potential pharmacological targets (<a href=\"https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41573-020-00056-6/d41573-020-00056-6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Superti-Furga et al, Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2020</a>). With a well-defined action plan, we are currently pushing towards a paradigm-shift in the science of human cellular transporters by creating a massive, historical advance in knowledge on hundreds of individual transporters and the way they act together.</p><h2><strong>The Superti-Furga Laboratory\u00a0</strong></h2><p>The Superti-Furga group (<a href=\"http://superti-furga-lab.at/\" target=\"_blank\">http://superti-furga-lab.at/</a><u>)</u> is composed of an international and highly productive team of more than 30 scientists. As a leader in the field, the laboratory investigates how cells and biological systems in general manage access to the environment through cellular transport. In particular how access to nutrients and energy source is tuned to metabolism and need of individual cell types. Moreover, the lab has pioneered approaches for functional precision medicine. The laboratory operates on a truly multidisciplinary basis and involves functional genomics and proteomics, structural analysis, chemical biology, high-content imaging, bioinformatics and physiology, reflecting the blend of expertise of the laboratory members (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2282-0\" target=\"_blank\">Heinz et al, Nature. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0483-3\" target=\"_blank\">Girardi et al, Nat Chem Biol. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19871-x\" target=\"_blank\">Girardi et al, Nat Commun. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00386-8\" target=\"_blank\">Li et al, Nat Metab. 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27329-x\" target=\"_blank\">Pemovska et al, Nat Commun. 2021</a>).</p><h2><strong>About the Institute</strong></h2><p>CeMM is one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading biomedical research institutes. CeMM researchers routinely publish important discoveries in top journals. Over the last seven years, this included &gt;10 papers in Nature/Cell/Science/NEJM and &gt;30 papers in Nature/Cell sister journals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a team of 120-150 scientists. Research at CeMM is exceptionally collaborative and has strong focus on medical impact, based on a profound molecular understanding of diseases such as cancer and immune disorders. CeMM is part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a founding member of EU-LIFE. It is located at the center of one of the largest medical campuses in Europe, within walking distance of Vienna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical city center. A study by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d put CeMM among the top-5 best places to work in academia worldwide (<a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676</a>).
