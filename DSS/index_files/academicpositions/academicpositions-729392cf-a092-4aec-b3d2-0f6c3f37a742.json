It offers 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle programs in biology, chemistry, geology, geography, mathematics, physics and veterinary medicine.</p><p>The Department of Physics of UNamur is recruiting a full-time lecturer who will provide bachelor's and master's in Physics. Research activities will be developed in UR LARN (<a href=\"https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/ur/larn\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.unamur.be/sciences/physique/ur/larn</a>) in the field of ion-inert matter interaction, will be based on existing equipment, in particular those of technological platforms (<a href=\"http://platforms.unamur.be/\" target=\"_blank\">http://platforms.unamur.be/</a>) and will be practiced in particular within the framework of the NISM institute. For example, the fundamental study of irradiation damage is a promising field given its importance in accelerator technology, in space flights or in the dismantling of nuclear power plants. The production of new materials by ion implantation, the characterization of materials, e.g. in the field of heritage sciences, or astrophysics are other possible directions of research. These research activities will be carried out in priority on the current accelerator ALTAIS which produces low energy particles but also on medium energy accelerators within the framework of national and international collaborations.</p><p><strong>Your missions</strong></p><p>Within the Department of Physics, you will take on teaching, research and service missions, and more specifically:</p><p>\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Carry out high-level original fundamental and / or applied research in the field of ion-inert matter interaction.
