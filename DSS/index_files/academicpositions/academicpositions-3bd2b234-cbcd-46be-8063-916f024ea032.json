BAP-2022-87)LEER is a research and education center of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the KU Leuven. We aim for independent state-of-the-art academic research on public economics issues with economic tools (see www.feb.kuleuven.be/leer).Website unitProjectSince the spring of 2020, the world experienced the largest disruption of education in history which affected 94% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student population. Due to the restrictions owing to COVID-19, schools in more than 190 countries had to close for several months in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although the school lockdown was initially widely accepted as a necessary measure to deal with the rising pandemic, many researchers, teachers, parents and policy-makers voiced concern about the lost progress for students and resulting educational inequality. A common critique is that policy-makers are well-informed about the benefits of school closures, by a vast amount of research modelling the spread of the pandemic, while information about the costs of school closures is lacking. This research proposal fills this void by estimating the short and long run impact of the COVID-19 crisis and its school closures.As the emerging evidence on the short run effects of the COVID-19 school closures suggests a strong and heterogenous impact on students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 performance (Maldonado &amp; De Witte, 2021; Gambi &amp; De Witte, 2022), as a PhD researcher you will examine the long run impact of the school closures as well as the impact of governing structures and initiatives that potentially mitigate the learning losses. As such, the overall objective of the PhD research is threefold: (I) It contributes to the wider economics of education literature by exploiting the unique natural experiment of the COVID-19 school closures to measure how schooling and instruction time impacts human capital formation. (II) It informs the policy debate on educational reform by examining the determinants and evolution of the learning losses. (III) It provides evidence on the impact of methods (rooted in behavioural economics) to mitigate learning losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the four year PhD study, the PhD researcher writes at least four papers which will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp;ProfileThe Research Center \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leuven Economics of Education Research\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Faculty of Economics and Business - KU Leuven) is looking for an enthusiastic and motivated junior scholar to conduct a PhD in economics.
