Considering the quasi-brittle nature of the masonry material and its deterioration due to aging and environmental effects, the prediction of its nonlinear response is crucial with respect to the structural assessment. This is especially the case for multi-wythe structures, in which the bonding pattern of masonry across the thickness has a strong influence on the mechanical response. In this respect, a model to predict the interaction between the different masonry's constituents, i.e. units, joints, and unit-joint interfaces, until failure and its impact on the mechanical performances of the material is required. For this purpose, various modelling approaches can be used among witch detailed brick-to-brick or analytical-based homogenisation models. The former provides a very accurate prediction, but requires high computational costs and often relays on a large amount of input parameters that are difficult to be determined via in-situ investigation with limited invasiveness. The latter results often in fast calculation and use limited input parameters, but relays on a simplified description of the behaviour and interaction of masonry's constituents.</p> <p>In this project, you will develop, validate and compare detailed brick-to-brick model and analytical-based homogenisation techniques to describe the nonlinear response of masonry. A large set of experimental data is available for validation. However, the possibility to carry out additional experimental tests is foreseen either as direct work or via cooperation with other team members.</p> <p>The candidate will work in the group of Structural Mechanics under the supervision of Dr Rita Esposito and Prof Jan Rots.
