There is a vital need to ensure that our road infrastructure assets and networks are sustainable and resilient to climate variability and change.&nbsp;A major problem throughout Canada, but particularly in northern communities, is maintenance and building of sustainable road infrastructure, as freeze-thaw cycles and/or climate change quickly degrade road structures. There is an urgent need for research in sustainable and resilient roads throughout Canada. The stability of road foundation systems in many Canadian northern communities relies on the strength of the underlying permafrost. The permafrost degradation due to global warming has been severely affecting the performance of many roads constructed in northern Canada, increasing their maintenance costs, decreasing their useful life span, and jeopardizing the economic activities in the North. Candidates in all related fields of geotechnical engineering are encouraged to apply, but&nbsp;preference will be given to&nbsp;applicants with research strength in cold region roads. &nbsp;&nbsp;Title of the position:&nbsp;Assistant or Associate Professor, the rank of Full Professor will be considered under exceptional circumstances.Duties:&nbsp;The functions of a member of the academic staff include, in varying proportions: a) teaching activities; b) scholarly activities revealed by research or professional work; c) supervision of graduate students; d) academic and professional service activities.
