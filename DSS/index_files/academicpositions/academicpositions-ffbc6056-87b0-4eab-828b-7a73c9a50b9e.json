ZAP-2022-11)In the Science, Engineering and Technology Group, Faculty of Engineering Science, Department of Chemical Engineering, division Bio- &amp; Chemical Systems Technology, Reactor Engineering and Safety (CREaS) at KU Leuven, there is a full-time academic vacancy in the field of 'Computational Methodologies for Advanced Optimization and Control of Chemical and Biochemical Reactor Processes' at Leuven (Arenberg). We are looking for internationally oriented candidates with an excellent research record and with educational competence within the field of (bio)chemical engineering that provides a fertile range of applications for the computational optimization and control methodologies to be developed. To accomplish its mission of exploiting and enhancing (bio)chemical reactor processes and process safety, CREaS integrates expertise, methodologies and techniques from different (bio)chemical reactor and process engineering domains, going from macro- and microscopic analysis of (bio)chemical processes, via modelling and design, to process optimization and control. The CREaS Research division is embedded within the Department of Chemical Engineering and is housed with its Leuven (Arenberg) based cohort in the Chem&amp;Tech facility, which is a recently built high-tech centre for chemistry and chemical engineering research. Moreover, in 2021 an adjacent brand new didactical building (Quadrivium) is inaugurated, which hosts new didactics lab and pilot hall spaces, together with PC, seminar and breakout rooms. The department has very strong links with the chemical industry throughout its industrial advisory board, research collaborations, structural embedding in its Chemical Engineering curriculum and its Safety Engineering curriculum. The latter is coordinated by the professor holding the Chair in Safety Engineering, installed by essenscia, which is the federation for the chemistry and life sciences industry. The chemical and live sciences industry is a very prominent sector in Belgium and Europe. The fifth largest chemical industry cluster worldwide is located in the port of Antwerp and Europe is the second largest chemical producer in the world.Website unitDutiesResearchYou are expected todevelop a research programme at an international level related to new computational methodologies that are to be used for model driven analysis, optimization and control of existing and/or innovative processes in the broad field of chemical and biochemical reactor engineering;have a thorough knowledge in the field of (bio)chemical engineering since the emphasis is primarily on applications in this field;strengthen the computational expertise of the division and the department, and be complementary to the more experimentally oriented profiles already present;&nbsp;validate your theoretical research results through relevant experimental and/or industrial applications;build a research group of international level with strong visibility;initiate collaborations with other research groups at KU Leuven with interest in (bio)chemical reactor engineering, computational methods, systems analysis and process control;publish at the highest scientific level, acquire competitive resources for research, supervise PhDs and set up international collaborations around your research programme.EducationYou ensure high-quality education, in particular in educational programmes at the bachelor and master level in Chemical Engineering.
