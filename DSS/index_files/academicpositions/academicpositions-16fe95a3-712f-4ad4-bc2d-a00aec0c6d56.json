BAP-2022-105)A postdoc position is available in the platelet genetics group in the Center for Molecular and Vascular Biology at KU Leuven. This lab is located on the Gasthuisberg campus of KULeuven in Leuven, Belgium, a rich biomedical research environment neighboring the University Hospital UZLeuven. Project : Today, high throughput-sequencing multi-gene panel tests comprising these genes can diagnose 48 to 26% of patients with platelet formation and function disorders, respectively. Many patients still remain undiagnosed and even with WGS data available, it remains extremely difficult to pinpoint the causative genetic defect because of the hundreds of rare coding variants present. This project therefore aims to deliver a rapid stem cell-based model to study known (but functionally undefined) and novel genes using CRISPR/Cas technology, quantitative in vivo imaging and genetic studies. Novel genes will be obtained from WGS data obtained for undiagnosed patients with very well-known platelet disorders, supplemented with platelet transcriptomes. This will allow WGS data analysis of differentially expressed genes. Validated novel candidate genes will be used to expand our existing diagnostic multi-gene panel test to increase detection of patients with the same IPD. This project will provide novel insights in platelet biology that is of use for therapeutic discoveries.Website unitResponsibilities\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You will have your own dedicated research project studying platelet genetics and disease modelling\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You will be responsible for administration and execution of the project.&nbsp;\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You will be expected to present the work at conferences, lab meetings, and departmental meetings.&nbsp;Profile* You are expected to have strong genetics, molecular biology and cell culture skills.
