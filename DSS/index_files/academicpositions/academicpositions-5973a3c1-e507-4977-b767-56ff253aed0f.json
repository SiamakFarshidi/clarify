A \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3,000 annual package for travels and equipment will be allotted.Research project (1/2 page \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1 page)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IP2I is a founding member of CMS experiment and had a key role in the development, installation and commissioning of the electromagnetic calorimeter and tracking detectors. The group has also made important contributions in the area of top quark physics and in the area of Higgs boson searches and measurements. In addition, the group is involved in the upgrade of CMS detector for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC, starting in 2027). Constructing the best detectors to collect data from the HL-LHC is of utmost importance to improve our understanding of the generation of mass in the Universe, solve anomalies observed at the LHC and possibly discover new particles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current CMS tracker will need to be completely replaced for the HL-LHC, to sustain the radiation level induced by the large increase in LHC luminosity. The IP2I has important responsibilities in the production and assembly of the future tracker endcaps (called TEDD detector).&nbsp;The construction of the TEDD mechanical structures (so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dees\u00e2\u0080\u0099) and their integration at IP2I will be performed in the next years within the LIO Clean room. These operations comprise Dee production, Dee mechanical and thermal qualification, the mounting of the silicon detector modules onto the Dees and a battery of detector module tests.&nbsp;The two last operations are called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cintegration phase\u00e2\u0080\u009d&nbsp;(2023-2025). The successful applicant is expected to make strong contributions to the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities in the&nbsp;tracker integration, especially&nbsp;the preparation and running of&nbsp;cold tests after mounting modules&nbsp;in the Clean room.&nbsp;The Post-doc tasks will consist in finalizing the development of the setup (data acquisition, control system) and performing statistical analyses. Possibilities for physics analysis of CMS data, in the area of expertise of the CMS IP2I group, can be discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The candidate will contribute to instrumentation activities, thus a prior experience in instrumentation is a plus. The candidate should also have strong coding skills, be able to contribute to data acquisition and control software. Although the work will be carried out mostly at IP2I, working periods at CERN are foreseen if Covid-19 restrictions permit. Results will be shown in international conferences and published in international instrumentation journals.Research field(s)Particle physicsDetector constructionSupervisor and contactName: Nicolas ChanonLaboratory: Institut de Physique des 2 Infinis de Lyon (IP2I Lyon)Phone number:&nbsp;+33 4 72 44 85 01&nbsp;Email: n.chanon@ipnl.in2p3.frWorking environmentJob location and descriptionThe Post-doc will be based at the IP2I, will be a member of the CMS IP2I group and become a member of the CMS experiment at CERN, signing all CMS publications. Activities will focus on instrumentation for CMS detector upgrade.If pandemic permits, frequent travels at CERN are foreseen, to participate in meetings, present results and perform tasks required by the CMS Collaboration at the detector.
