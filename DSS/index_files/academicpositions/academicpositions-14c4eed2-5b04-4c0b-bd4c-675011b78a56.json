The project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and led by Dr. Imke Harbers. The PhD candidate will be embedded in the Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research (AISSR) at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.</p><p>Citizenship grants access to the rights enjoyed by all members of the political community of a given state. Although we often think of undocumented persons as migrants or non-citizens, globally one in seven people have not had their birth registered, and thus do not possess official documents to prove their legal identity. The share of people who hold identity documents, but whose documents are deemed insufficient or inconclusive to prove citizenship, is even higher. For millions of people, the threat to their fundamental rights derives not from their legal status, but from their inability to prove this status. What accounts for this gap between citizenship as a legal status and the ability of citizens to document their claim to citizenship? If civil registration is not universal, who is left out? Why is access to civil registration uneven across societal groups? To answer these questions, the project conceptualizes civil registration as a tool used by political elites to include or exclude societal groups. The project uses a multi-method approach, combining quantitative demographic and spatial (GIS) datasets with fieldwork, archival sources, interviews and focus groups.</p><p>The PhD candidate selected for this position will conduct research on access to civil registration, legal identity and citizenship in India.
