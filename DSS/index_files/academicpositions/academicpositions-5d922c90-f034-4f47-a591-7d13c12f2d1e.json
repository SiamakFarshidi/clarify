This post is funded by the EPSRC project \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alkyl(aryl)iodonium Reagents for Late-Stage Alkylation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which investigates the design, synthesis and reactivity of hypervalent iodine reagents.&nbsp;The successful candidate will develop new alkyl(aryl)iodonium reagents, gain an understanding of their stability through mechanistic studies and demonstrate their usefulness as late-stage alkylating agents in catalysis.&nbsp;The candidate will write high quality scientific research articles, present research at national and international conferences, liaise with academic collaborators, contribute to the supervision of student projects and to the maintenance and smooth running of the research laboratory.Successful candidates must have a PhD (or near completion) &nbsp;in organic chemistry. In addition, candidates should have hands-on experience in synthetic organic chemistry and methodology development, including reactivity and mechanistic investigations. Experience with hypervalent iodine reagents is advantageous, but not essential. Excellent oral and written communication skills, teamworking skills, the ability to manage the day-to-day running of a research project and a track record of high-quality publications are expected. If English is not the candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first language, they must provide evidence that they meet the University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimum English Language requirements (IELTS 6.0 with at least 5.5 in each element).The post is available from 1st April 2022 and is fixed term for 36 months.&nbsp;Information about the O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Duill group and the School of Chemistry can be found at https://oduillgroup.com/ and http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/chemistry, respectively.
