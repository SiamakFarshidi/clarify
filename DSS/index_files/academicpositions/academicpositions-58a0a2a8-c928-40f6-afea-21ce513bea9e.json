Its success is associated with the morphotropic phase bound\u00c2\u00adary between rhombohedral (Zr-rich) and tetragonal (Ti-rich) compositions, where dielectric and piezoelectric properties exhibit extremes. Besides the intrinsic piezoelectric effect, extrinsic mechanisms related to the presence of domains contribute to the piezoelectric effect in ferroelec\u00c2\u00adtrics. In polycrystalline materials, neigh\u00c2\u00adboring grains interact elastically, piezoelectrically, and elec\u00c2\u00adtrically. The total macroscopic response of a piezoelectric therefore emerges from complex interactions of intrin\u00c2\u00adsic and extrinsic mechanisms.</p><p>Considering the toxicity of the heavy metal Pb, legislation of the European Union restricts the use of lead in piezoelectric devices unless exempted under specific conditions. Promising lead-free candidates are bismuth layer structured ferroelectrics like bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) and perovskites such as barium titanate (BaTiO3), bismuth sodium titanate ((Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3), and sodium potassium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3). The families of sodium potassium niobate, bismuth sodium titanate have the advantages of low dielectric constants, high coupling coefficient, and higher mechanical strength, in general, than lead containing ceramics that make them suitable for high frequency transducers. Apart from being nontoxic, their lower acoustic impedance makes them suitable for medical imaging. Bismuth layer structured ferroelectrics ceramics, on the other hand, seem to be suitable candidates as piezoelectric sensors for high temperature. <i>In order to better model the properties and improve the understanding of (lead-free) ferroelectric piezoelectric thin films, it is mandatory to understand the extrinsic mechanisms that are related to domains, domain walls, and their interaction in between each other but also with defects present in the material.</i></p><p><strong>Within this thesis, the successful candidate will study the piezoelectric behavior and domain kinetics in ferroelectric thin films using unique experimental techniques: (i) </strong><i><strong>time-resolved </strong></i><strong>X-ray diffraction during</strong><i><strong>\u00a0</strong></i><strong>electrical actuation at 3rd generation synchrotrons (ESRF, SOLEIL, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6) [1-2] and (ii) </strong><i><strong>in situ\u00a0</strong></i><strong>electrical actuation during TEM imaging using a novel TEM sample holder in an aberration corrected FEI TITAN [3]. The experiments are accompanied by finite element method simulations.</strong></p><p><strong>Competences:\u00a0</strong>The candidate should hold a Master degree in physics, materials science, or another closely related field. He/she should have a profound knowledge in solid state physics and a vivid interest in working experimentally. Experience in programming languages is appreciable.</p><p><strong>Applications should include a CV, two letters of recommendation, a statement of research interests, and the last transcript of grades</strong>.</p><p><strong>Application deadline: March 20th, 2022</strong></p><p>Funding: Doctoral contract (salary) (Funded by the\u00a0doctoral school 352)</p><p>Keywords:\u00a0piezoelectricity, ferroelectric, domains, <i>in situ</i> synchrotron X-ray diffraction, <i>in situ</i> TEM analyses</p><p><img alt=\"https://www.uni-due.de/imperia/md/images/ferroics/p5_jahresbericht20121.jpg\" class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/0fQ5dOGR00mFtSVcXzmpTxl2ZPFUWqzcSLndFYRT.jpg\" style=\"width:96.2%;\"/><img class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/1MlFXmQuT8hUvHuTVi4x3kBMmpazxOunffquBHqf.png\" style=\"width:82.59%;\"/><img class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/UuQTsu6EBPOierzHhXgV78OKx5HSky1dkvEodL1S.jpg\" style=\"width:93.76%;\"/></p><p>[1] T.W Cornelius, C.
