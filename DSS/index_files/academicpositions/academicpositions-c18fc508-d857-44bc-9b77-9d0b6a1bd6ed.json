Strong research and attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.The Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology conducts high-quality research and education in chemical sciences and molecular life sciences. Our research and education focuses on a deep understanding of chemical and biological processes in cells and in the environment. We address important societal issues such as antibiotic resistance, cancer, brain diseases, environmental problems and climate change.&nbsp;We are responsible for postgraduate education in the subject area Natural Sciences with a focus on chemistry, biophysics, biology and educational science. In addition, the department hosts educational programs in molecular biology, genomics and systems biology, chemistry, organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry, as well as prescription education. The department collaborates with various societal actors such as schools, business and authorities. The Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology has around 200 employees. We are located in central premises both on Campus Johanneberg and on Campus Medicinareberget in Gothenburg.&nbsp;The Neutze and Br\u00c3\u00a4nd\u00c3\u00a9n groups will shortly perform a coherent X-ray scattering study of microtubules at the European X-ray free electron laser (EU-XFEL, Hamburg). This experiment builds directly from earlier studies using XFEL radiation and involves the collection of many terabytes of experimental data which must be processed. Closely related X-ray scattering studies of ensembles of microtubules will shortly be performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), but involving the microtubule samples being perturbed by an applied electric field. We are seeking to appoint a qualified scientist to a two-year position to analyze data collected at both experiments. This position will therefore focus on the analysis and modelling of X-ray scattering data from microtubules recorded using both XFEL and synchrotron radiation.Job assignmentsX-ray scattering data collected at the EU-XFEL and ESRF must be processed and analyzed. We are therefore looking for a specialist who can develop and extend scripts custom-written to process these types of data. The successful candidate must be familiar with data formats associated with X-ray detectors used at both facilities, and be confident in writing data-processing scripts using MatLab. Moreover, the successful candidate must have a solid understanding of the foundations of X-ray scattering theory and understand how these experimental data may be interpreted in terms of protein structure. The overriding task is to bring the analysis of these X-ray scattering data to a level where scientific conclusions can be drawn and the work published. Experience in presenting the results of such an analysis (eg. through manuscripts or a PhD thesis) is a merit.QualificationsThe successful candidate must have a master level qualification in chemistry, molecular biology, structural biology or its equivalent. The successful candidate must also have several years working experience in the analysis of X-ray scattering data recorded using both XFEL radiation and synchrotron radiation. The successful candidate must also have a working knowledge of the programming language MatLab.&nbsp;Experience in presenting results from X-ray scattering studies (eg. in publications or a PhD thesis) is a merit.&nbsp;EmploymentThe employment is fixed term, fulltime, 100% during 2 years at the&nbsp;Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology.For further information regarding the positioncontact professor: Richard Neutze, e-mail:&nbsp;richard.neutze@gu.seUnionsUnion representatives at the University of Gothenburg:https://www.gu.se/en/about-the-university/work-at-the-university-of-gothenburg/how-to-applyInformation for International ApplicantsChoosing a career in a foreign country is a big step.
