Through this consortium, you will have at your disposal all prospective data on hip osteoarthritis (OA) in the world. The main technical focus is on constructing machine learning models to predict disease development and progression. Aside from the clinical importance of these models, this project offers interesting challenges and opportunities for research into techniques for causal effect estimation, missing data, and learning from multiple data sources.<br><br>Background: OA of the hip is a chronic, painful, and disabling disease of the joints and is forecasted to become the most prevalent disease in the Netherlands by the year 2040. However, due to a lack of knowledge on the etiology and risk factors for hip OA there are no curative or preventive options and current treatment is therefore limited to a 'one size fits all' approach. By using a large dataset, a prediction model could potentially identify person specific risk factors for development and progression of hip OA, thereby creating opportunities for person-specific treatment and preventive actions.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<ul>\n<li>You must have a master degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, or a related field and have some experience with machine learning techniques.</li>\n<li>You should be familiar with programming (Python, R or a similar scientific programming language).</li>\n<li>You should be enthusiastic to bridge the gap between research and practice and have motivation and ability to work both independently and as a member of a large team.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>", "conditions_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Conditions of employment</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<ul>\n<li>You will receive a temporary position for 4 years.
