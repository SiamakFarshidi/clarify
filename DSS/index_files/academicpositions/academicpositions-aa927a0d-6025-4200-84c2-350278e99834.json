That is what you aim to find out as a PhD candidate.

The focus is on comprehension of narrative and expository texts, and on not only the reading outcome, but also on the reading process (such as inattention during reading/mind wandering). <br><br>The project involves three studies, and includes eye-tracking and EEG. This project will be embedded in a larger Vici grant project called \u2018Opportunities and Challenges in the Children's Comprehension of Multiple Digital Texts\u2019 conducted by two PhD candidates and two postdoctoral researchers at BSI and Stichting Cito.
