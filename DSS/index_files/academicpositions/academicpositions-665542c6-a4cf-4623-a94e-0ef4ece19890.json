The education includes relevant courses to about six months of study, a dissertation based on independent research, participation in national and international research environments, relevant academic communication, a trial lecture and public defence. Read more about the PhD education at UiS on our website.The appointment is&nbsp;for three years with&nbsp;research duties&nbsp;exclusively.Research topicThe&nbsp;project that the&nbsp;PhD&nbsp;Fellow will be affiliated to&nbsp;will focus on the application of data-driven solutions based on AI and machine learning techniques for energy systems engineering.Due to high penetration of intermittent renewables and ongoing transition in EU energy system from large-scale centralized generation towards small-scale distributed generation, the emphasis is put on the controllable distributed energy generation technologies.Since these technologies are installed close to the consumption points, where they are operated by non-technical prosumers with very limited access to maintenance services, they should offer high availability and reliability to avoid unexpected outages and secure the supply. Therefore, this project investigates advanced and smart solutions based on AI and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of distributed generation units, utilizing the domain knowledge and data. Given the fact that the development of data-driven algorithms requires operational data with appropriate quality and quantity, both experimental and simulated data are considered to be used in the project.Qualification requirementsWe are looking for applicants with&nbsp;a strong academic background who have completed&nbsp;a five-year master degree (3+2)&nbsp;within mechanical engineering or other relevant engineering fields, with strong focus on energy technologies, turbomachinery, applied computational/data science, preferably acquired recently. &nbsp;Other corresponding qualifications that could provide a basis for successfully completing a doctorate may also be relevant.To be eligible for admission to the doctoral programmes at the University of Stavanger both the grade for&nbsp;your master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thesis and the weighted average grade of&nbsp;your master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree must individually be equivalent to or better than a B grade.&nbsp;Applicants with an education from an institution with a different grade scale than A-F, and/or with other types of credits than sp/ECTS, must&nbsp;attach a confirmed conversion scale that shows how the grades can be compared with the Norwegian A-F scale and a Diploma Supplement or similar that explains the scope of the subject that are included in the education.
