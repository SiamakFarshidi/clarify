John van Noort. The main focus in the group is the organization of DNA in eukaryotes and the development of single-molecule techniques to study this. In addition, as part of a small group of research technicians, up to 25% of your time will be spend on supporting related work of other groups in and outside LION.&nbsp;Key responsibilitiesThe successful candidate will be expected to:Design new DNA substrates with various sequences and chemical modifications;Functionalize proteins and microfluidic devices to include specific interactions and fluorophores;Produce designed DNA substrates in high quality for reconstitution of chromatin;Help graduate and undergraduate students with various backgrounds (physics/biology/chemistry) to handle these materials and successfully perform experiments with them;Keep up to date with technical advances in the field of molecular biology and introduce them to the group;Manage the safety and inventory of a small molecular biology laboratory;Actively participate in sharing knowledge with a team of research technicians.Selection criteriaThe successful candidate should:Have relevant working experience, preferably as a graduate student in the field of molecular biology and/or (bio)physicsHave a practical \u00e2\u0080\u0098can-do\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attitude and experience in the DNA manipulation, analysis and purification (techniques such as: PCR, digestion, cloning, plasmid harvesting, capillary electrophoresis, Nanopore sequencing)Be a flexible, enthusiastic and independent co-worker that exercises a high quality standard while taking initiative to improve methods and practices in the lab.Be able to communicate with colleagues on scientific topics in fluent English (oral/written).Research at our faculty and instituteThe Leiden Institute of Physics (LION) is one of the oldest physics institute in the Netherlands. LION is part of the Faculty of Sciences at Leiden University and covers a broad spectrum of physics research and education. Ranging from cosmology to the mechanics of DNA, from the physics of jamming in granular materials to quantum nano-science, from protein folding to super lubricity. All topics are covered by joined efforts in theory and experiment. One of LION\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core research efforts is Biophysics.Within LION van Noort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biophysics group is working on DNA organization. The research is an interdisciplinary mixture of physics, chemistry and (molecular) biology and focuses on:1. Resolving the structure of DNA organization in eukaryotes2. Studying the relation between DNA organization and transcription regulation3. Development of instrumentation and statistical physics models to advance single-molecule studiesTerms and conditionsSalary range from \u00e2\u0082\u00ac 2.846, to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac 4.490 gross per month on a 1,0 fte base (pay scale 10), depending on education and experience level of the candidate.
