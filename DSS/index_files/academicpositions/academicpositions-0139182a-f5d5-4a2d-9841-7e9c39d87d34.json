Sustaining burning plasmas close to ignition conditions, while achieving sufficient power spreading on the dedicated divertor components, imposes stringent constraints on the operational window of these plasmas. This calls for the design of optimized scenarios for ITER, dedicated to controlling the heat flow from the thermonuclear source to the divertor. The design of such optimized scenarios will require reliable numerical simulations with novel capabilities, in order to predict turbulent transport and plasma wall interactions in global realistic geometries.A one-year postdoctoral position (renewable) is opened between the M2P2 laboratory in Marseilles, the research group on fusion modelling at CEA Cadarache, with the goal of&nbsp;sustaining the simulation activity of tokamak plasmas. This job is dedicated to the development and the optimization of a new hybridizable discontinous Galerkin solver which has been recently implemented in the code SOLEDGE2D-HDG (Giorgiani et al. JCP 2018), part of our well-referenced numerical fluid platform SOLEDGE2D-EIRENE (Bufferand et al. Nuc. Fus. 2015).&nbsp;Differently from most of the codes presently running in the fusion community, SOLEDGE2D-HDG implements a high-order numerical scheme, whose enhanced accuracy allows us to use meshes that are not aligned on the magnetic field lines nor the flux surfaces, and therefore are independent on the geometrical features of the magnetic equilibrium. These features will allow us to address heat exhaust physics in non-steady magnetic configurations, an absolute novelty in the landscape of plasma transport codes. Those unsteady conditions, that can prove to be critical in most plasma scenarios, are met at plasma breakdown, or in the current ramp-up when the magnetic field evolves from limiter to divertor configuration, and also during flat top operation, for instance when sweeping the divertor strike points or with MHD relaxation events such as sawteeth. Associated to unstructured meshes, this solver will allow in addition to accurately discretize any realistic tokamak chamber.The succesfull candidate will contribute to the enanchement of this new HDG solver, on one hand with a research activity on novel numerical techniques (advanced time discretization schemes, adaptive techniques, extension to 3D geometry, linear system solvers, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6), and on the other participating to the code optimization (code vectorization, improvement of the Open/MPI parallel aspects). This activity will be associated to plasma simulations in realistic tokamak geometry, and in close connection with experimental analysis on WEST (http://west.cea.fr/en/index.php).&nbsp;This work will be carried out&nbsp;in close connection between applied mathematicians and numericists from Aix-Marseille University and plasma physicists at CEA Cadarache. It is part of the&nbsp;TOP project recently granted by the Aix-Marseille University foundation AMIDEX in the frame of the Initiative d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Excellence of the French government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QUALIFICATIONS/SKILLS/EDUCATION &amp; RESEARCH REQUIREMENTSCandidates should have a demonstrated knowledge in finite-elements method or a related field in applied mathematics and/or in computational fluid mechanics.
