Why do many families have a similar gendered division of work and care, although other possible solutions exist that may be more adapted to their lives?This project, funded by the Belgian Research Fund FNRS, is addressing these questions by focusing on the role of coexisting and potential conflicting social norms of motherhood.Background: A recent European directive aims to promote gender equality by providing men with more generous incentives to assume care responsibilities. This attempt contrasts with the prevailing idea that women are mainly responsible for their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care. In fact, women made great achievements towards gender equality in professional life and gender egalitarian attitudes have widely spread in all spheres of life. Nevertheless, women much more than men reduce their work for caring responsibilities. Normative models that oscillate between traditional and modern mother roles are likely to reduce the effectiveness of recent policies and may thwart economic progress. Despite many studies investigating this stalled revolution, a differentiated view on coexistent and potential conflicting motherhood norms remains elusive and descriptive, since within-country norm plurality has been neglected.Approach: In this project, we draw on Belgium as an excellent case study; its parental leave policy combines high levels of flexibility and gender neutrality and may serve as a role model; still, leave take-up remains gendered. This finding is puzzling, as Belgium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leave policy offers parents more individualized solutions of work-family arrangements than in many other countries. Relying on a multi-method sequential approach, we analyse survey data and conduct focus group discussions (conducted in French-speaking Belgium) to identify normative discourses. In close collaboration with the University of Vienna, we evaluate in a most-different case design with Austria whether an overarching norm of good motherhood exists in these different country contexts. Whereas in Belgium mothers tend to return quickly to work after childbirth, Austrian mothers spend years on parental leave. Using individual interviews with French-speaking young mothers, we study how mothers integrate these normative constructs into their everyday lives. Finally, we estimate how conflicting norms relate to mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 employment.Job descriptionThe PhD student will focus on the qualitative part of this project, documenting and analysing the normative discourses (focus groups) and mothers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 life strategies (individual interviews).Preparation of a dissertationPublication of research articles and presentations in international conferencesIntegration into the research project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team through collaboration in researchInvolvement in research administration (e.g., preparation of meetings, workshops, conferences, managing website\u00e2\u0080\u00a6)ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONBenefitsThis position offers the opportunity todevelop qualitative method skills through interviews and focus groups.contribute to a project that triangulates methods (focus group discussions, individual interviews, quantitative survey data);join an international research cooperation with University of Vienna, Austria;work in an international research group;access to the doctoral training offered at UCLouvain;participate in conferences and have research stays abroad.Selection processWe ask you to submit:a motivation letter,your complete CV, including the grades obtained during your Master programme and the names and contact details of two reference persons.Candidates who are shortlisted will be asked to submit written work (e.g. MA thesis or papers) at a later stage.ProcedureYou may apply for this position until 28 February 2022 12:00pm.Send your application (all documents in one pdf file) to christine.schnor@uclouvain.be, mentioning in the subject PHD POSITION DEMO 01-2022.Interviews with the selection committee will take place in mid-March.InformationCandidates who want more information about the research project or the recruitment process should contact christine.schnor@uclouvain.be.Additional commentsCenter for Demographic Research (DEMO)The Center for Demographic Research (DEMO) at the Universit\u00c3\u00a9 Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) belongs to the Institute for the Analysis of Change in Contemporary and Historical Societies (IACCHOS).
