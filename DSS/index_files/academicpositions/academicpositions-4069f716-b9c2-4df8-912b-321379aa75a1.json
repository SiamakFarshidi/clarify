Institutions with the authority to raise funds on financial markets to provide grants, loans or guarantees were present at the outset of the European Communities and part of European responses to the economic crises of the 1970s, the reuniting of Europe in the 1990s and the euro crisis in the 2010s. They are now pivotal to the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID-19 response, including the Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan to borrow \u00e2\u0082\u00ac750 billion to help with the costs of the pandemic. This project will generate new evidence on: (1) the evolution and accountability of pan-European public financial institutions since 1950; (2) who drives these developments and what this means for accountability; and (3) how accountable these bodies are in practice and how to strengthen their accountability. Our findings will encourage governments, parliaments, NGOs and pan-European public financial institutions to explore new and stronger accountability practices.</p><p><strong>What we expect from you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</strong></p><ul><li>PhD in political science (political economy), history or a cognate discipline: defence completed successfully by the time of application.</li><li>Fluency in English; a good ability to read in two of following four languages: German, French, Italian and Dutch.</li><li>Experience with archive research preferred.</li><li>Experience interviewing policy-makers on technical issues preferred.</li><li>Background in social science research methods (qualitative and quantitative methods).</li><li>Research background in European Union / European integration studies.</li><li>Proven track record of publications preferred: at least one peer-reviewed journal article accepted for publication.</li><li>Experience working on a short-term (1-3 year) research project with tight deadlines preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>We Offer...</strong></p><p>Excellent salary and work conditions in a global top 300 university.</p><p>Research work on one of the main topics of European economic governance today.</p><p><strong>In Short...</strong></p><ul><li>Contract Type: Fixed Term Contract 24 Month</li><li>Work Hours: Full Time 40.0 Hours per Week</li><li>Foreseen starting date: June 2022</li><li>Location:\u00a0Belval</li><li>Job Reference:\u00a0UOL04594 - INTER/UKRI/21/15560511; Acronym: BANK-EU</li></ul><p><strong>How to apply...</strong></p><p>Applications should be submitted online and include:</p><ul><li>Curriculum Vitae</li><li>Cover letter</li><li>Copies of diplomas</li></ul><p>We ensure a full consideration for applications received by 15 January 2022.
