Our universities community has its competitive edges in technology, health and society. www.tuni.fi/en&nbsp;The researcher becomes a member of Human-Centered Technology (IHTE) research group, which focuses on design research for new technologies and digital applications. The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aim is to improve people's quality of life and to promote the sustainable development of society through research, the results of which can be used to develop new technological solutions for various application areas. The research is multidisciplinary in nature and includes both practical and theoretical perspectives.The IHTE research group is part of Computing Sciences unit, whose research is characterized by IT-related business collaboration and the application of research results in practice. The unit belongs to the Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences of the University of Tampere.Description of the positionsThere are a total of two fixed-term positions to be applied for in two research projects: 1) AI Hub Tampere - artificial intelligence (AI) applications for well-being and health, and 2) ALL-YOUTH - digital services for the social participation of young people. Below are brief descriptions of the project topics and key tasks of the researchers.1) AI Hub Tampere - well-being and health&nbsp;related AI applications, duration approx. 1.5 yearsThe AI Hub project&nbsp; develops, among other things, well-being and health related AI applications and their design methods together with companies in Pirkanmaa. The aim of the project is to facilitate the application of digitalisation using artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector. We approach the issue from a human-centered design perspective, aiming to increase the trust and transparency of AI, maintain people's autonomy in the deployment of AI, and ensure the accessibility, smoothness and sustainability of services. The work is done on the basis of the needs of companies in Pirkanmaa region by mapping their needs related to AI, and by organizing workshops and short research periods with companies. The topics of the research depend on the needs of the companies, but they can be related to, for example, the development of AI that supports the well-being of employees or the development of the interaction of a robot working in healthcare. The project involves several research groups at the University of Tampere, e.g. in the fields of AI, information technology and robotics.Key tasks of the researcher in the AI Hub project:Determining business needs in the area of well-being and health artificial intelligence applicationsUser and business research on well-being and health artificial intelligence applicationsBusiness cooperation; planning, organizing and conducting studies and workshops with the various actors in the projectHuman-centered design of artificial intelligence applications - concept design and user interface design and their evaluation by end usersWriting publications and communication on project resultsIn addition, the selected person may have separately agreed project management tasks, communication tasks or teaching tasks in the topic of human-centered design.2) ALL-YOUTH - digital services for the social participation of young people, duration approx. 1 year 3 monthsYoung people want to&nbsp;rule their lives&nbsp;(ALL-YOUTH) is a multidisciplinary project that examines the abilities and barriers to the social participation of young people aged 16-25 and their perceptions of sustainable development, growth and well-being.
