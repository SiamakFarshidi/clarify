We offer a position of 3 years to investigate, by developing and using coupled hydrodynamics-ecosystem models, the full feedback between sandeel (Ammodytes spp) and its environment, i.e. habitat, predation and food. We anticipate to elucidate sandeel-zooplankton dynamics (food) in relation to its value and importance as food organism for higher trophic levels (birds, seals).&nbsp;LOCATION:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ROYAL NIOZ TEXEL (THE NETHERLANDS)&nbsp;VACANCY ID:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2021-39CLOSING DATE:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March 10th 2022THE DEPARTMENTThe Departments of Coastal Systems (COS) and Estuarine and Delta Systems (EDS) study coastal ecosystems and their populations of fish, birds and other marine animals in the North and Wadden Seas as well as on a global scale. The departments focus on key physical, chemical and biological processes that determine the productivity and the ecological functioning of coastal areas. The coastal system is studied as a unit by considering the interrelations between the key compartments of the ecosystem (water, sediment, microalgae, macro zoobenthos, parasites, fish, birds and marine mammals).&nbsp; &nbsp;THE PROJECTThe growing human population requires sustainable food and energy supply, which puts pressure on the marine environment. This will influence primary and secondary production and propagate up through the food web to higher trophic levels. In the North Sea, the key link between planktonic production and top predators are the so-called forage fish, including herring, sprat, and sandeel.&nbsp;This vacancy is part of a wider project that studies the importance of sandeels as forage fish for top predators, and focusses on the factors which determine the occurrence and production of sandeel.Extensive anthropogenic developments are planned for the southern North Sea including offshore windfarms and seaweed-farms, and proposed sites often coincide with major sandeel habitats. The project studies how sandeel distribution is shaped by abiotic covariates (sediment, depth and temperature), food availability (zooplankton production) and predator distributions. These relationships will be simulated using an integrated population - dynamic energy budget model and with a 3D ecosystem model (ERSEM-BFM) aiming at scenario simulation to illustrate how lower-level changes in habitat and productivity might propagate to higher trophic levels.THE VACANCYThe postdoc will implement sandeel biology and productivity in the ERSEM-BFM ecosystem model, using results from other parts of the project. Implementation will be done in a 1D model version, and the postdoc will use a 3D application to the north-west European continental shelf to run a 10-year hindcast of physical, biogeochemical and ecological variables, including sandeel biomass. The results will be analysed for inter-annual variability and driving factors influencing the sandeel population. A sensitivity study will be carried out to further understanding of selected driving factors for the carrying capacity for the sandeel population. This will be inspired by and cross-compared with results obtained with other models used in the project. The postdoc will publish the work in 3-4 peer-reviewed journal papers. The preferred start date is 1 January 2022.The work will be carried out under the supervision of&nbsp;dr. Johan van der Molen, and is part of a wider project that includes observations and links to seal populations and includes collaborations with Wageningen Marine Research, University of Wageningen, Rijkswaterstaat, Cefas and the University of St. Andrews.THE CANDIDATE&nbsp;You have a PhD in a physical science (physics, mathematics or oceanography), and experience with or a strong interest in marine science and biology. You are a good programmer, preferably with experience in Fortran and Python, and have a solid background in numerical modelling. Knowledge of parallel computing in Linux, biogeochemistry and/or fish ecology are an advantage. Affinity with ecological processes and functioning, including Dynamic Energy Balance concepts and models, is also desirable. You are able to understand, develop and apply existing complex community models/software as part of a small team that works within a wider community of developers/users/researchers. As such, you can work independently on your own research, while contributing to the goals of the team and the community, and collaborating with field scientists. You are not afraid to ask questions, and seek support when needed. You have presented your work at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and will continue to do so as part of this project.&nbsp;CONDITIONSEmployment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by&nbsp;NWO (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research). We offer a position for a period of approximately 3 years (full time). The salary is compliant to the&nbsp;CAO-OI (Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Research Institutes), a pension scheme, a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, a year-end bonus of 8,3% of the gross annual salary, flexible work arrangements and 42 days of holiday leave (full time position).&nbsp;You may expect attractive secondary employment conditions. We offer generous relocation expenses for employees coming from abroad and support with finding accommodation.&nbsp;Royal NIOZ is located on the beautiful island&nbsp;Texel. Texel offers sun, wind and beach, and a diverse but moderate level of facilities, including a thriving tourist industry, shops, sports facilities, primary schools and a high school. It is connected to the main land by an hourly to half-hourly ferry service, with crossings taking 20 minutes. The Royal NIOZ is situated next to the ferry terminal.MORE INFORMATIONPlease apply online at&nbsp;www.workingatnioz.com&nbsp; For additional information about this vacancy, please contact&nbsp;dr.
