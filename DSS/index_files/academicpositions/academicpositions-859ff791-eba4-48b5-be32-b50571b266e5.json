Interested candidates should hold a PhD degree and have an excellent background in analytical techniques such as UHPLC and/or nano-LC, and mass spectrometry, as well as strong computational skills. Expert theoretical and practical knowledge of Orbitrap mass spectrometers and proteomics data processing software solutions (e.g. Xcalibur, Proteome Discoverer, Maxquant, Spectronaute, Skyline or similar) is required. Additionally, a thorough understanding of protein chemistry and biochemistry is desirable. The candidate should also have experience in project management, be well-organized, e\u00ef\u00ac\u0083cient, and have strong oral and written communication skills in English. The successful candidate should have a high level of energy and motivation to apply his/her expertise and knowledge in a stimulating research environment. Salary and conditions are commensurate with experience.Your profilePhD in analytical sciences or life sciencesExcellent background in UHPLC and/or nano-LC, and mass spectrometryExpert theoretical and practical knowledge ofOrbitrap mass spectrometersExpert knowledge in proteomics data processing software solutionsThorough understanding of protein chemistry and/or biochemistryVery good command of EnglishHigh accuracy and reliabilityTeam playerExcellent communication skillsOrganizational talentThe Molecular Discovery PlatformThe CeMM Molecular Discovery Platform uses a technology-driven approach to empower the discovery and characterization of such bioactive molecules, including proteins, metabolites, and novel synthetic compounds. These three classes of molecules are also the focus of the three modules that constitute the CeMM Molecular Discovery Platform \u00e2\u0080\u0094&nbsp;Proteomics,&nbsp;Metabolomics, and&nbsp;Chemical Screening. Using the latest technologies and state-of-the art instrumentation, we maximize coverage to biomolecules and enable data generation from minimal biological sample amounts. The platform, with its three sub-facilities, provides services to all groups at CeMM as well as to external customers and thereby intends to contribute initial starting points towards discovering the therapies of the future.The Proteomics FacilityThe Proteomics Facility provides services on \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate-of-the-art\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mass spectrometry-based proteomics applications to support scientific research groups in basic and translational research. The special design of the MS lab guarantees our customers the highest standards for \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh resolution accurate mass\u00e2\u0080\u009d (HRAM) LC-MS instrumentation of the Q Exactive and Fusion Lumos Orbitrap series with sta\u00ef\u00ac\u0080 maintaining and operating the systems at a constant high level.The mass spectrometry laboratory space was designed to the highest standards when the group relocated to the new CeMM building on the medical campus. To operate under optimal conditions in an analytically suitable environment, each machine resides in an individual cubicle that is maintained at constant temperature and humidity. Minimal downtime is assured via remote surveillance whereby the performance of the systems can be consistently monitored. Di\u00ef\u00ac\u0080erent proteomics work-flows are well established in the facility including protein identification and profiling, quantitative expression proteomics, quantitative phospho-proteomics, Immunoprecipitation and A\u00ef\u00ac\u0083nity Purification Mass Spectrometry (IP-MS/AP-MS), as well as targeted Parallel Reaction Monitoring (tPRM). Standard Operation Procedures for Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA), Data Independent Acquisition (DIA), and multiplexed isobaric tagging (TMT) are routinely performed. The state-of-the-art machine park and methodology allows for a robust investigation of the human proteome in di\u00ef\u00ac\u0080erent cell types and biological matrices.About the InstituteCeMM is one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading biomedical research institutes. CeMM researchers routinely publish important discoveries in top journals. Over the last seven years, this included &gt;10 papers in Nature/Cell/Science/NEJM and &gt;30 papers in Nature/Cell sister journals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a team of 120-150 scientists. Research at CeMM is exceptionally collaborative and has strong focus on medical impact, based on a profound molecular understanding of diseases such as cancer and immune disorders.CeMM is part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a founding member of EU-LIFE. It is located at the center of one of the largest medical campuses in Europe, within walking distance of Vienna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical city center. A study by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d put CeMM among the top-5 best places to work in academia worldwide (https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676). Vienna is frequently ranked the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best city to live. It is a United Nations city with a large English-speaking community. The o\u00ef\u00ac\u0083cial language at CeMM is English, and &gt;49 di\u00ef\u00ac\u0080erent nationalities are represented at the institute.
