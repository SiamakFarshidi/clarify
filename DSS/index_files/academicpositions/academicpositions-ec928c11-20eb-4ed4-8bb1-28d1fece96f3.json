The SIDC is the PI institute for instruments onboard the PROBA2, PROBA-3 and Solar Orbiter space missions. It also harbours the World Data Centre for the Sunspot Index and a Space Weather forecast centre. The group consists of 4 permanent staff researchers, 31 contractual researchers, 7 PhD students and 6 support staff.At the University of Li\u00c3\u00a8ge, the successful candidate will be affiliated with the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering (A&amp;M) of the School of Engineering and, therefore, will be in direct connection with the Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge.A&amp;M is both a teaching department and a research unit. Building on the heritage of the former LTAS (Laboratoire de Techniques A\u00c3\u00a9roSpatiales), it has achieved international recognition for the development of advanced numerical methods and tools and their applications in aerospace engineering. Numerical modeling forms the backbone of A&amp;M research and is effectively complemented by a long expertise in experimental measurements that can leverage state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment. A&amp;M is particularly active in the fields of aerospace engineering, materials and processes, energy conversion, mechanical systems, and biomechanics.A&amp;M is committed to the development of multilateral and interdisciplinary scientific collaborations with other academic partners, research institutes and private companies/industries, at both the regional and international levels, to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and to support high level education/training programs.The Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge is an applied research centre of the University of Li\u00c3\u00a8ge focusing on the design of space observation instruments. In addition, the CSL has a state-of-the-art environmental test centre serving the European Space Agency (ESA), the space industry and regional companies. The CSL has been contributing to numerous missions to observe the cosmos, the earth and its atmosphere, meteorology, developed largely by ESA and to a lesser extent by NASA. In particular, it has a long-standing expertise in leading the development of space solar instruments, e.g. onboard the SOHO, PROBA2, PROBA-3, and Solar Orbiter missions. The CSL has developed software for satellites equipped with radar, built part of an instrument or been the prime contractor in the construction of an instrument and, in many cases, carried out the very delicate and sometimes very long tests, under space conditions, of many instruments and even entire satellites. Along these missions, the about 100 engineers, physicists and technicians of the Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge have developed a strong expertise in extremely varied fields such as optics, electronics, lasers and non-destructive testing of various materials, thermics, surface analysis and structure, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6A detailed description of the A&amp;M department, the Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge, the Royal Observatory of Belgium and their activities can be found on their websites http://www.am.uliege.be, http://www.csl.uliege.be, https://www.astro.oma.be/en/, and http://sidc.be/aboutSIDC.Research activitiesThe general objective of the FED-tWIN Profile is to conceive the next generation of solar space-borne instrumentation by pioneering new technologies and designs optimized for future solar physics. The ultimate goal of the FED-tWIN expert is to prepare the concept of new space-borne instruments to observe the Sun for the upcoming mission calls in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA).A particular attention will be paid to the technological developments required to measure the magnetic field in the solar corona, to improve the solar coronagraphy, to provide extreme-violet (EUV) imaging of the solar corona at very high spatial resolution and to measure flare energy in a broad spectral range.The successful candidate is expected to take a leading role internationally in the conception and development of space instruments for solar physics missions, to acquire competitive research funding, and to aim at excellence in research i.e. by publishing in outstanding journals and giving presentations at the main conferences in the field.Teaching activitiesThe part-time academic position requires a contribution to the teaching activities organized by the A&amp;M department, including the development of specific courses in the field of opto-thermo-mechanical design of space experiments and hardware, in the framework of the master programmes in aerospace engineering and in engineering physics.He/she will additionally take part in the supervision of internships, final year projects and PhD projects in his/her field of research.The teaching load may not exceed 125 hours per year (including any practical work and seminars).&nbsp;Service activitiesThe selected candidate will participate in service activities to ensure the visibility and promotion of the activities developed at the Royal Observatory of Belgium and at the department of Aerospace &amp; Mechanical Engineering of the School of Engineering.
