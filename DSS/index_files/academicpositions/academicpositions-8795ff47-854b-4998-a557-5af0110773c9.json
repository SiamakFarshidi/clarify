Thousands of hectares of diseased trees have had to be felled in recent years. When it comes to reforesting these areas, questions arise as to how to optimise the ways in which they are composed and managed. At the same time, forests in the tropics are being affected by global change. Their surface area is shrinking, and the landscape is becoming fragmented, mainly due to agricultural conversion and charcoal production. Tree mortality rates are increasing due to increased seasonality and large fauna are disappearing due to poaching. The way in which they function is being disrupted, their role as a carbon sink is diminishing and zoonotic diseases are increasing. Given the many ecosystem services provided by these ecosystems, close monitoring of their biodiversity and health status, in relation to human and animal health, is necessary. This monitoring should be based on networks of field-based approaches. It must also use efficient tools to document threats and deal with them quickly. This notion of \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be considered in a broad sense and from the perspective of maintaining ecosystem services over the long term.Teaching activitiesThe successful candidate will support teaching at GxABT, both in the Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree (courses in Forest Ecosystem Management, Biosphere, Agriculture, Society, Current Environmental Issues) and in the Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in Bioengineering in Forest and Natural Area Management (modules on Forest Health, Tropical Forestry, Silviculture) They will also support teaching of the interfaculty Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne Health\u00e2\u0080\u009d degree (ecosystems part).Research ActivitiesThe Forest is Life research and teaching support unit (CARE) has a unique wildlife monitoring network, both in Wallonia and in Central Africa. It also houses a very high resolution remote sensing platform. The scientists involved in the CARE have a wide range of skills and integrating these skills into research would enable the design of effective monitoring systems for intact and damaged forests, plantations, urban forests and agroforests. The successful candidate will be able to analyse this monitoring data to design (1) preventive management methods adapted to the threats and crises facing temperate and tropical (agro)forestry systems and (2) crisis management systems based on innovative real-time information transmission tools.&nbsp;Services to the CommunityDue to issues currently being addressed (deforestation, degradation, climate impacts, etc.) and the geographical scope, the successful candidate will be able to make a useful contribution to the following dynamics and structures within the University: Viva Science, Green Office, Pacodel, Open Science, and with regard to the faculty themes of sustainable campus and international mobility. Synergies with the university NGO Eclosio will be sought.&nbsp;Other community service activities will be determined in consultation with senior staff.Qualifications required / profileMust hold a first degree in agronomic engineering (or bioengineering) or a Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree and a doctoral research degree with experience in the relevant field;Must demonstrate recognised scientific experience, both in the field and through publications at international level in the relevant field;Must be open-minded to the international world (having completed a scientific stay abroad of at least six months is an advantage);Must be a good teacher (teaching experience is an advantage);Must demonstrate the ability to work on interdisciplinary themes;Must be able to work independently and within a team, using pooled human and material resources within the GxABT facilities, and must have excellent organisational skills and the ability to coordinate technical staff;Must be available for a variety of different roles relating to services to the community and public education;Master French and English (including writing);Must be available for missions abroad;Must subscribe to the general quality objectives developed by the University and the faculty;Upon appointment, the post holder must sign an agreement on the ownership of any research results.Selection&nbsp;procedureAn ad hoc Faculty committee will select the candidates to be interviewed, giving reasons for its decisions in the light of the call for applications and the candidates' qualifications and merits.
