The research focus is on developing feminist theory and methods, as well as on critical studies of power in relation to contemporary and historical formations of gender. Gender Studies offers interdisciplinary perspectives on the formation and transformation of gender and its intersections with other power structures, such as race, sexuality, class, and nationality and an interest in how such intersections become meaningful and materialise in various historical, geographical, political, social and cultural contexts.&nbsp;Doctoral studies at the Department of Gender Studies is part of the research area of Critical and Cultural Theory, which is an interdisciplinary research environment with seven subjects in the humanities.

We welcome submissions from applicants with a variety of research interests and previous research experience in the areas of digital media and digital intimacy, sexual health and sexual rights, LGBTQ+ communities and sexual politics, and participatory, future-oriented approaches to tech design.
