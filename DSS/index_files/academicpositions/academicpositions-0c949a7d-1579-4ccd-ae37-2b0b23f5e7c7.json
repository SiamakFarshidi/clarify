The contacts made of silicide (Fig. 1) are essential for the good performance of these transistors and are obtained by reaction between a metal film and the silicon substrate. For microelectronic processes, it is therefore important to understand and control the formation and stability of silicides which takes place by reactive diffusion (diffusion + reaction).\u00a0</p><p>For the most advanced technologies, metal alloys replace pure metals to improve the final properties of the contact: for example, the Ni(10%Pt) alloy, is largely used since it strongly increases the thermal stability of the NiSi contact.</p><p><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Jsi5XNuwqWLUcEHDOufXjpozJBZU8CBk0UnMvWEH.png\"/></p><p><strong>Fig. \u00a01 : MOS transistors with silicide contacts</strong></p><p><img class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/79l0DwcIWUjtAJTl0mFWk40ZbhfUm8PR8eYre4oc.png\" style=\"width:39.25%;\"/></p><p><strong>Fig. 2\u00a0: Ni-Co-Si phase diagram</strong></p><p>Other alloys are currently being studied but, despite numerous studies on silicide formation [1], several fundamental aspects are still poorly understood, especially in concentrated alloys. In particular, the link between thin film reactions and the ternary phase diagram (Fig. 2) is not well established. The kinetics of these reactions also plays a key role and is generally controlled by the diffusion of metal or silicon in the forming phases. However, the measurement of the self-diffusion (diffusion of the element in the compound) is difficult and requires the use of isotopes. Recently, we measured the diffusion of Si in NiSi using isotope-enriched Si multilayers and the tomographic atom probe (Fig. 3). We have also shown that silicon self-diffusion controls the thermal stability of the Ni silicide [2]. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The purpose of this thesis is to study the formation of silicides in thin films from concentrated alloys. As Ni and Co silicides are used in microelectronics, the Ni-Co-Si system (Fig. 2) will be studied first and other ternary systems can be defined later. From the experiments, we will try to establish through modeling and simulations the link between kinetics (diffusion) and thermodynamics (phase diagram).</p><p><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/lV5pzNR3huJWJP9PL5q0sqnbpxQUiIr6lgtGOuZY.png\"/></p><p><strong>Fig. 2: Tomographic atomic probe (TAP) showing Si isotopes after dewetting of NiSi on Si substrate [2]</strong></p><p>This thesis will be carried out in the RDI team of the MATER department of the IM2NP which is specialized in thin film reactions and diffusion. This team has many experimental means for both the growth of thin films and their characterization: in particular the Tomographic Atomic Probe (TAP) allows to analyze the materials in 3D and at the atomic scale and to differentiate the different isotopes of the metal and/or Si.\u00a0 \u00a0The PhD student will use different experimental techniques for the experiments.</p><p>In particularly, the alloys will be deposited by magnetron sputtering on Si substrates or on layers (or multilayers) of Si28 isotopes (study of Si self-diffusion). Different types of annealing will be applied for the formation of silicides and self-diffusion which will be characterized by measurements of resistance, X-ray diffraction (nature of the phases, texture...) and X-ray reflectivity (thickness, roughness). The diffusion will be studied from the distribution of isotopes measured by atomic probe in 3D and at nanometric scale. Modeling and simulations performed in the team or through collaborations (U. Changsha/China...) will be used to analyze the results. This thesis proposes an original experimental approach based on a unique combination of techniques to study fundamental reaction phenomena in nanoscale materials with applications in microelectronics.</p><p>References\u00a0:</p><p>[1]\u00a0D.
