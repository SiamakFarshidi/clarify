It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are committed by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own scientific discipline. Their aim is to benefit science and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The research carried out at the Faculty of Science ranges from mathematics, computer science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organized in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor\u2019s and twelve master\u2019s programs. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located in Leiden\u2019s Bio Science Park, one of Europe\u2019s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more information, see\u00e2\u0080\u00af<a href=\"https://workingat.leiden.edu/\">https://workingat.leiden.edu/</a>\u00e2\u0080\u00afand\u00e2\u0080\u00af<a href=\"https://www.science.leidenuniv.nl/\">https://www.science.leidenuniv.nl</a>\u00e2\u0080\u00af\u00a0\u00a0and\u00e2\u0080\u00af<a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/about-faculty-of-science/diversity\">https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/about-faculty-of-science/diversity</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Utrecht University</strong></p>\n<p>A better future for everyone.
