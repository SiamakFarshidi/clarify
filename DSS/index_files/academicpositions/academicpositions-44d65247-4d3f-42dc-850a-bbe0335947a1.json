The communication routes are good both nationally and internationally. The research focuses within the fields of Atom- and Molecular Physics, Condensed Matter Physics and Spintronics, and Complex Systems and Biophysics and is performed in an international environment with extensive national and international collaborations. The education programs at the Department include Bachelor- and Master programs in Physics, physics teacher-training programs, as well as outreach courses in Physics aimed for the general public.The research group works in theoretical and statistical physics, classical and quantum. On the quantum side we work on many-particle systems in condensed- matter and atomic physics, on the classical side on the mathematical analysis of models for particles in turbulence and reaction-diffusion systems.Job assignmentsThe goal of PhD project 1 is to develop quantum-field theoretical methods (both analytical and numerical) that describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of classical and quantum systems, and to apply these methods to experimentally relevant situations.The goal of PhD project 2 is to develop statistical methods for interactions and collisions of particles in turbulence, and to analyse these models with perturbation theory, asymptotic methods, and numerics.As a PhD student you are expected to independently contribute to the development of mathematical models and their analysis with analytical and numerical methods.Being a PhD is a 4 year full-time studies and leads to a Doctoral Degree. Those who are employed as doctoral students must primarily devote themselves to their doctoral education. However, a doctoral student may to a limited extent work with education, research and administration. Such work may, before the doctoral degree is completed, not cover more than 20 % of full-time work.EligibilityTo be eligible for third-cycle studies, the applicant must meet both the general and specific entry requirements:A person meets the general entry requirements for third-cycle courses and study programs if he or she:has been awarded a second-cycle qualification,has satisfied the requirements for courses comprising at least 240 credits of which at least 60 credits were awarded in the second-cycle,orhas acquired substantially equivalent knowledge in some other way in Sweden or abroad.To meet the specific entry requirements for third-cycle studies, applicants must: (i) have a second-cycle (advanced -level) degree in a relevant* subject area in the natural sciences, or (ii) have completed studies for at least 60 higher education credits at a second-cycle level in relevant subject areas in the natural sciences, or (iii) have completed a corresponding programme of relevance to the planned third-cycle programme, in Sweden or in another country, or have equivalent qualifications.*Relevant for the planned third-cycle educationThe specific entry requirements also include an acceptable command of spoken and written English. Guidelines for assessing English proficiency may include a minimum score of 550 on the TOEFL test (or 213 on the TOEFL-CBT, or 79 on the TOEFL-iBT).AssessmentRegulations for the evaluation of qualifications for education on a doctoral level are given in SFS 1993:100.We are looking for highly motivated individuals with substantial experience and interest in analytical and numerical calculations in statistical, atomic, or condensed-matter physics. A genuine enthusiasm to work with experimental data is required. The successful candidates will demonstrate outstanding experience of independently pursuing analytical calculations (e.g. using singular perturbation theory, tensor analysis, quantum-mechanical few-body calculations, or quantum-field theory), and will be expected to perform advanced numerical simulations of model systems, quantum or classical.EmploymentType of employment: Fixed-term employment, 4 years full timeExtent: 100 %Location: Department of Physics, GothenburgFirst day of employment: February 2022 or by agreementAppointment procedureThe application shall include:Cover letterCV including scientific publicationsSummary of your previous experience in theoretical physics (max one A4 page)Copy or draft of the Master thesisCopy of exam certificatesTwo letters of reference to johannes.hofmann@physics.gu.seFor further information regarding the positionDr. Johannes Benedict Hofmann&nbsp;johannes.hofmann@physics.gu.seProfessor Bernhard Mehlig&nbsp;bernhard.mehlig@physics.gu.seUnionsUnion representatives at the University of Gothenburg:&nbsp;http://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/job-opportunities/union-representativesHow to applyIn order to apply for a position at the University of Gothenburg, you have to register an account in our online recruitment system.
