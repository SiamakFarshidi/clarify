The position is available from 1 September 2022 and is part of the research project \u00e2\u0080\u0098A World without Images: Uncovering the absence of figurative representations in Early Neolithic northern Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099 funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.</p><p><strong>Project description</strong><br/>The overall goal of the project is to explain why figurative representations are missing among Northern Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first farmers. As farming spread from southeast to central Europe, the number of figurines decreased and when agriculture expanded to northern Europe, they had disappeared. The project seeks explanations for the absence of figurines in deep socio-cultural and ritual-religious differences dividing Neolithic Europe in a figurative southeastern part and an imageless northern part. This will include the identification and analyses of shifts in social organization and ritual-religious practices across early agricultural communities in southeast and central Europe.</p><p>The successful candidate will be part of a small research group consisting of the Principal Investigator and one postdoc and will be based at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, under supervision of Principal Investigator of the project, Associate Professor Rune Iversen.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong><br/>The PhD fellow will carry out independent research on the central European Neolithic including the Linear Pottery culture and later groups. The position will include data collection, comparative analyses and presentation of results. The data collection will focus on two main aspects: the presence of figurines and the manifestations of changes in social organization across Neolithic groups. The main task will be to collect and record the relevant data in a custom-made database and help with performing detailed distribution maps in GIS in order to investigate similarities and differences in material culture. The gathered information will be incorporated into a wider analysis referring to the main project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research question.</p><p>Responsibilities and key tasks as a PhD fellow:</p><ul><li>Carry through an independent research project under supervision.</li><li>Complete PhD courses or other equivalent education corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS.</li><li>Participate in active research environments, including a stay at another research institution.</li><li>Teaching and knowledge dissemination activities corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS.</li><li>Write scientific papers aimed at high-impact journals (article-based dissertation).</li><li>Write and defend a PhD thesis on the basis of your project.</li></ul><p><strong>Qualification requirements</strong><br/>The ideal candidate will have a background in central European archaeology with a MA specialization in the Neolithic. We seek candidates with good interpersonal skills, the ability to organise work independently and the potential to produce high-quality research.
