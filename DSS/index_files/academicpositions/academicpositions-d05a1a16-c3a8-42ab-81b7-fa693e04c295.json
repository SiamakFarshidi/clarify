An important focus of our research is how these abiotic-biotic interactions create value for society, following for examples of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding with Nature\u00e2\u0080\u009d paradigm or investigating sustainable sources of marine biomass for food.&nbsp;THE PROJECTAs part of the NWO-funded project From Sea to Society, smart breeding of the brown seaweed species &nbsp;S. latissima will be performed in close cooperation with Hortimare. Goal of the breeding will be to produce S. latissima with more biomass and higher protein yields. The breeding will be done by selection and sterile sporophytes will be produced that cannot interbreed with natural populations, preventing gene flow into the marine ecosystem. NIOZ/Hortimare will perform a 3-stage breeding trial approach (from lab to sea) to quantitatively assess the added value of the kelp varieties and to extensively validate the sterility of sporophytes. The biomass that is produced will be handed over to partners in the project for biorefinery optimization. The PhD will work in the interdisciplinary research project From Sea to Society &nbsp;together with chemists, modellers and social scientists. The full text of the granted research project From Sea to Society is available on request.THE CANDIDATEAre you a highly motivated researcher with an MSc in (marine) biology /plant physiology. Do you have a keen interest in frontier-based research in an interdisciplinary scientific environment? Do you have experience with experimental work both in the laboratory and at field sites, and/or plant breeding? In this project you will learn and apply state-of-the-art analytical techniques and research concepts to cross scientific boundaries. You will work in an interdisciplinary research environment; a very good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse background, including LGBT+ and BAME communities, to join us.CONDITIONSEmployment of this position at Royal NIOZ is by NWO (The Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research).
