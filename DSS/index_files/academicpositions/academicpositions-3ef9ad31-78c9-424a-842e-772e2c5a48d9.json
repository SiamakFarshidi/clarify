Microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) constitute an alternative platform to femtosecond mode-locked lasers for realizing frequency combs on a chip scale. Their compactness, compatibility with standard semiconductor fabrication techniques and large (&gt; 10 GHz) line spacing enable new opportunities in frequency synthesis and metrology: from advanced communications to radio-frequency photonics.In the past years, our group has demonstrated microcombs based on silicon nitride with outstanding performance in terms of conversion efficiency. We have shown the potential of these light sources in the context of coherent optical communications and explored nonlinear physics in an arrangement of linearly coupled cavities. We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join our team and investigate new research avenues based on this platform, comprising the exploration of different operational wavelengths for optical spectroscopy, the realization of phase-coherent light wave communications or the synthesis of high-frequency microwaves. The research project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Swedish Research Council (VR).The Photonics laboratory at the Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department (MC2) is a dynamic and creative group with about 30 members working in an international and collaborative atmosphere. We perform both curiosity-driven and applied-research in the areas of optoelectronics, nano photonics, and fiber optic systems. We enjoy a state-of-the-art laboratory for microcomb research and have access to in-house cleanroom facilities to manufacture our own photonic devices based on silicon nitride.Major responsibilitiesAs postdoctoral fellow, your main responsibilities are to lead and conduct research, and guide junior PhD students. You will have the freedom to contribute with your ideas and collaborate with other senior researchers and professors.QualificationsYou should have a PhD degree (or equivalent) in Applied Physics, Engineering Physics, Electrical Engineering or similar. You must have experience with supervision of junior students (PhD or Master). You must have solid experience with laser frequency combs.Knowledge of standard finite element solvers and computational techniques in nonlinear optics (generalized nonlinear Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger equation, Lugiato-Lefever equation, etc.) is a plus.Contract termsThe postdoctoral position is a full-time employment position limited to 2 years. We offer a competitive salary, excellent working conditions and access to world-class facilities and infrastructure. Starting date is negotiable.We offerChalmers offers a cultivating and inspiring working environment in the coastal city of&nbsp;Gothenburg.&nbsp;Read more about&nbsp;working at Chalmers&nbsp;and our&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;for employees.Chalmers aims to actively improve our gender balance.
