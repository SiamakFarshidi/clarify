Strong research and attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.</p><p>Research and graduate education at the department of chemistry and molecular biology comprises a wide scientific field from the atomic and molecular levels all the way through cells to intact organisms. Much of the phenomena studied here impact on our natural environment and living systems. We participate in undergraduate programs in chemistry, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, biology, marine sciences, and pharmacy.</p><p>A third cycle education at our department will lead to a Ph.D. in Natural sciences, or Natural sciences with a specialisation in Chemistry. Ph.D. studies comprises four years at the post graduate level. The time period can be extended to 5 years in total through teaching and/or other departmental duties.</p><p>Westenhoff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research group, where this position is placed, has the goal to uncover structural dynamics of proteins and chemical reactions. The research is placed at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics. We develop new methods based on infrared spectroscopy and time-resolved X-ray scattering to achieve this goal.</p><h2>Job assignments</h2><p>We are looking for one doctoral student within Westenhoff\u00c2\u00a8s ERC projekt \u00e2\u0080\u009dMolStrucDyn\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p><p>The objectives of the projects are to determine structural changes in photosensor proteins.
