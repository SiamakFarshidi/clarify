Although vaccines have been developed, SARS-CoV-2 is still actively spreading and new variants are constantly emerging. The impact of new mutations in the viral proteins responsible for viral replication and transcription is still poorly understood. We recently developed a SARS-CoV-2 mini-genome assay to identify new inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication and test the effect of mutations in the viral replication proteins on viral RNA synthesis and the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to current antivirals, such as remdesivir or favipiravir.</p><p>About&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;role</p><p>We are looking for an enthusiastic postdoc to work a joint project between the Laboratory of Applied Evolutionary Biology of the Amsterdam University Medical Center (location AMC), the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), and the Department of Molecular Biology of Princeton University. The appointed postdoc will work on a ZonMW/NWO funded project to study SARS-CoV-2 replication and the impact of mutations in variants of concern (VoC) on SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to antivirals and replication kinetics.</p><p>The postdoc will be primarily responsible for the continued development of the SARS-CoV-2 replication activity assay, the screening of inhibitor libraries, and the testing of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations using in vitro and virus assays. There will be ample opportunities to develop other skills and contribute to multiple aspects of the project.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><em><strong>We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic Postdoctoral Researcher (Postdoc) with experience in molecular cloning, transfections, and protein expression.</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have a PhD and track record of publishing your results in peer reviewed journals.</li>\n<li>You have outstanding experimental research skills and academic skills, are well organized, goal-oriented and results-driven, and have a strong team spirit, but you can also function independently.</li>\n<li>You have excellent communication skills and are fluent in speaking and writing in English.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>", "conditions_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Conditions of employment</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Fixed-term</strong> contract: 12 months with the possibility for an extension.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working on a large-scale research project, with motivated colleagues from all over the world.</li>\n<li>We offer a contract for a year (12 months)\u00a0with the possibility for an extension.</li>\n<li>Additional benefits include an 8.3% end-of-year bonus and 8.0% holiday pay.</li>\n<li>The base salary does not include holiday pay (8%) and a year-end bonus (8.3%).\u00a0</li>\n<li>In addition to excellent accessibility by public transport, AMC also has a sufficient number of parking spaces for employees.</li>\n<li>Salary is by experience according to Dutch UMC CAO.</li>\n<li>Pension is accrued at Be Frank.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>", "employer_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Employer</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<h4>Amsterdam UMC</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amc.nl/web/home.htm\">Amsterdam UMC</a> is a leading medical center that combines\u00a0complex high-quality patient care, innovative scientific research, and education of the next generation health care professionals.
