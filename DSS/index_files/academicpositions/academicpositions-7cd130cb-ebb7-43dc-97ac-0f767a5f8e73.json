Assessors face multiple uncertainties and have to resort to general codes that is likely to induce conservatism and possible underestimation of the true safety, while in other cases overestimations may occur. For example, there is need for more guidance into the quasi-brittle nature of old multi-wythe masonry material behaviour and replacing linear-elastic based design checks by calibrated nonlinear computational models that better account for redistribution capacities and possible hidden reserves in the structures.</p> <p>For this project, we are looking for two full-time candidates, who will work in cooperation.</p> <p>One candidate will focus on the structural analysis of city infrastructures. A review of potential failure mechanics will be carried out at first, followed by selection of case studies to be analysed. Nonlinear finite element analyses based on continuum damage models will be performed, including parametric and sensitivity studies.</p> <p>The other candidate will perform experimental work to characterise the response of multi-wythe masonry, taking advantage of samples extracted from existing infrastructures. He/She will design and carry out various material characterisation tests for mortar, bricks and masonry (e.g. double punch test, core test, compression/shear/bending test on wallets/triplets).</p> <p>The candidate will work in the group of Structural Mechanics under the supervision of Dr Rita Esposito, Dr Francesco Messali and Prof Jan Rots.
