This will involve the development of new production routes and processes that have been proven to minimise their environmental footprint through quantified assessment. Bioengineers have a role to play in this transition process as highlighted in the conclusions of our forward-looking workshops dedicated to the challenges facing bioengineers in 2030. This is also reflected in the objectives of Wallonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart specialisation strategy (Strategic Innovation Areas), which emphasise reducing the energy and environmental impact of its food production. For the bioengineer, the subject is complex because it covers processes from production through to the end of the transformation chain. The evolution of these sectors towards green production by managing assessments, reducing needs and losses (carbon footprint, water costs) and also by increasing value through recycling or recapitalisation must be guided by a quantified scientific evaluation. While many processes related to the production and processing of agricultural products are already studied within the Faculty, a cross-sectional assessment of the environmental balance of the entire value chain is as yet untouched in light of the challenges mentioned above.</p><p><u>Teaching activities</u></p><p>The teaching activities consist of the introduction of environmental evaluation in courses directly related to components of the water-soil-air continuum and/or involving the use of material and energy resources (e.g. the use of water and energy in the production of electricity):\u00a0GERE0024-1, <i>Ecosystem-atmosphere exchange under climate change</i>; GERE0034-1, <i>Practical assessment of soil and water resources</i>; GERE0025-1,<i> Digital eco-design</i>; GERE0028-2, <i>Physics of construction and special techniques</i>).\u00a0</p><p>Activities also include:</p><ul><li>A contribution to the course \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Introduction to Environmental Assessment</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d (ENVT2049-2, two credits) given by a faculty member of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, by providing concrete cases related to the production and processing of agricultural products.\u00a0</li><li>Responsibility for the activity \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Field applications and visits</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d (two credits) in the Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Bioengineering in environmental sciences and technologies, which should illustrate, through visits to companies and institutions, the notions of reducing the impact of human activity on the environment.</li></ul><p><u>Research Activities</u></p><p>The specific research activities of the position will focus on the environmental balance of one or more stages related to the production/processing of agricultural products, namely:</p><ul><li>Quantify the resources needed and the losses in the different environmental compartments (greenhouse gases or reagents, water, energy);\u00a0</li><li>Propose itineraries with a lower impact in light of the most recent knowledge.\u00a0</li><li>Integrating results into tools such as Life Cycle Assessment and participating in the development and improvement of these tools.\u00a0</li></ul><p>To develop applied research, the successful candidate will draw on the knowledge of other <i>TERRA</i> researchers in the field of environmental exchange and energy management.\u00a0</p><p><u>Services to the Community</u></p><p>According to their skills, the successful candidate will be able to become actively involved in the Faculty Commission for Sustainable Development and to participate in facilitating the <i>VivaSciences</i> and <i>Green Office\u00a0</i>workshops.
