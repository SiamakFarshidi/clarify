Strong research and attractive study programmes attract scientists and students from around the world. With new knowledge and new perspectives, the University contributes to a better future.Research and graduate education at the department of chemistry and molecular biology comprises a wide scientific field from the atomic and molecular levels all the way through cells to intact organisms. Much of the phenomena studied here impact on our natural environment and living systems. We participate in undergraduate programs in chemistry, molecular biology, medicinal chemistry, biology, marine sciences, and pharmacy.A third cycle education at our department will lead to a Ph.D. in Natural sciences, or Natural sciences with a specialisation in Chemistry. Ph.D. studies comprises four years at the post graduate level. The time period can be extended to 5 years in total through teaching and/or other departmental duties.Westenhoff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research group, where this position is placed, has the goal to uncover structural dynamics of proteins and chemical reactions. The research is placed at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics. We develop new methods based on infrared spectroscopy and time-resolved X-ray scattering to achieve this goal.Job assignmentsWe are looking for one doctoral student within Westenhoff\u00c2\u00a8s ERC projekt \u00e2\u0080\u009dMolStrucDyn\u00e2\u0080\u009d.The objectives of the projects are to determine structural changes in photosensor proteins. We plan use ultrashort X-ray pulses from free electron laser sources and single-particle cryo electron microscopy to reach these goals.You are expected to be involved in all steps of the project, i.e. to prepare and to perform experiments and to analyze and to publish the data. The choice of sub-project will be adjusted to the successful candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest and experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working duties may include:Planning, preparation, and implementation of time-resolved X-ray diffraction experiments at free electron laser sources.Protein production and crystal optimizationStructure determinationIdentification and publication of the resultsScientific collaboration within and outside the groupCommunication of the resultsThe position is placed at the University of Gothenburg until May 2023. The candidate is thereafter expected to move to the University of Uppsala together with Westenhoffs research team.&nbsp;EligibilityTo be eligible for third-cycle studies, the applicant must meet both the general and specific entry requirements: A person meets the general entry requirements for third-cycle courses and study programs if he or she:Has been awarded a second-cycle qualification, orHas satisfied the requirements for courses comprising at least 240 credits of which at least 60 credits were awarded in the second-cycle, orHas acquired substantially equivalent knowledge in some other way in Sweden or abroad.To meet the specific entry requirements for third-cycle studies, applicants must: (i) have a second-cycle (advanced-level) degree in a relevant* subject area in the natural sciences, or (ii) have completed studies for at least 60 higher education credits at a second-cycle level in relevant subject areas in the natural sciences, or (iii) have completed a corresponding program of relevance to the planned third-cycle program, in Sweden or in another country, or have equivalent qualifications.*Relevant for the planned third-cycle educationThe specific entry requirements also include an acceptable command of spoken and written English. Guidelines for assessing English proficiency may include a minimum score of 550 on the TOEFL test (or 213 on the TOEFL-CBT, or 79 on the TOEFL-iBT).AssessmentAs a competitive candidate you:Hold a degree (Masters/ or equivalent, see above for more details)Have documented research experience in biochemistry, structural biology, or an area related to the project.Have the proven ability to work independently and result-driven in a research project.Are a dynamic team player.In return, you will be given extensive creative space to develop the project, significant resources to produce cutting edge results, and you will profit from being part of our highly collaborative team.Regulations for the evaluation of qualifications for education on a doctoral level are given in SFS 1998:80.* We will give preference to candidates, which are likely to succeed exceptionally well within the project.* Documented experience in biochemistry, structural biology, or biophysics are necessary. Experience in scientific programming, molecular modelling or crystallography are a merit.* The ability to work independently on a research project is a merit.* The ability to work effectively in a team is also a merit.EmploymentType of employment: Fixed-term employment, Four years full timeExtent: 100 %Location: Department of Chemistry and Molecular Biology, GothenburgFirst day of employment: As agreedRegulations for the evaluation of qualifications for education on a doctoral level are given in SFS 1998:80.A new employment as a PhD student applies for a maximum of one year.
