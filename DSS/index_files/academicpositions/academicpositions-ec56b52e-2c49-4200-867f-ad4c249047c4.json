Inequalities will be studied in relation to major societal processes, ongoing digitalization, and associated changes in urban economies and the transition toward post-Covid cities. In addition, implications of climate change, the energy transition, and the greening of economies for urban inequality are highly relevant. Such processes will be studied in cities both in the Global North and South, and may focus on specific demographic groups, such as youth, older adults, immigrants, low-income groups, racial and sexual minorities, or other groups.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p>We are looking for a professor who fits well with the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PhD in (Human) Geography or a closely linked discipline with international expertise in the field of urban inequalities;</li>\n<li>excellent social, organisational and management skills;</li>\n<li>excellent track record and innovative approach in teaching at different levels; (a willingness to obtain) a senior teaching qualification (\u00e2\u0080\u0098<a href=\"https://www.uu.nl/en/education/centre-for-academic-teaching/senior-university-teaching-qualification-sko\">SKO</a>\u00e2\u0080\u0099);</li>\n<li>inspiring vision and a strong reputation in research, through successful engagement with international networks, excellent publication records and success in securing grants for projects that contribute to the development of the research field;</li>\n<li>international visibility and embedding in relevant research networks; </li>\n<li>experience in establishing and leading research groups and engagement in mentoring of early career researchers;</li>\n<li>experience and successful engagement with stakeholders from industry, government and civil society;</li>\n<li>interest in societal challenges related to sustainable development; </li>\n<li>dedication to and skills for inspiring and inclusive leadership, ensuring collaboration, cohesion and transparency; </li>\n<li>willingness to acquire Dutch language skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>Utrecht University invites and encourages applications from all qualified individuals, including groups that are traditionally underrepresented in employment to contribute to further diversification.
