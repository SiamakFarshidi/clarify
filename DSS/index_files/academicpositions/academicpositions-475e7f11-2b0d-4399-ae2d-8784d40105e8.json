The candidate will be working on the Governance &amp; Privacy perspective of the project, which, amongst other things, aims at investigating the relationship between privacy and data protection, on the one hand, and security, on the other hand.&nbsp;</p><p>INTERSECT holds that when building security-by-design, security-by-default, robustness, and resilience into IoT devices themselves is not possible, we must also have legal, regulatory, and governance capabilities to address or prevent potential threats. The first line of inquiry of the project thus relates about how personal data protection law and neighbouring legislation (e.g. GDPR, NIS Directive, ePrivacy Directive, the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, the AI Act Proposal) can be used to engender privacy and security in the IoT space, when security cannot be designed into IoT devices from the outset. Yet, while the axiom according to which &lsquo;there is no privacy without security&rsquo; still holds true, rethinking modern security practices for the IoT age can possibly lead to trade-offs between security, on the one hand, and the rights to privacy and personal data protection, on the other hand. The use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) more generally for security purposes is not devoid of potential threats to individuals&rsquo; privacy and data protection. Hence, this project&rsquo;s second line of inquiry investigates whether and how privacy and (IoT) security can clash.</p><p>The aim of this project is thus to analyse the privacy and data protection implications of autonomous vulnerability and exploitation detection and management in the IoT environment, with a particular reference to the methods and approach developed by the INTERSECT consortium. The project will identify the applicable norms and principles, delineate their scope, and formulate recommendations for the pursuit of an optimal trade-off between IoT security and personal data protection.</p><p>The successful candidate will:</p><ul> <li>Actively contribute to the INTERSECT research project.&nbsp;</li> <li>Independently pursue path-breaking research leading to an excellent PhD dissertation.</li> <li>Collaboratively pursue interdisciplinary research in collaboration with the project partners.</li> <li>Participate in the Tilburg Graduate Law School courses and activities.</li> <li>Be an active member of the department by participating in and organizing events and activities, presenting and discussing research output within the department, and representing the department outside Tilburg University.</li> <li>Supervise students in writing their Master thesis in Law &amp; Technology and reading and grading Master theses on a variety of topics.</li> </ul>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p>Tilburg University believes that academic excellence is achieved through the combination of outstanding research and education, in which social impact is made by sharing knowledge.

In this way, we want to contribute to solving complex social issues. Our focus areas are economics, business and entrepreneurship, social and behavioral sciences, law and public administration, the humanities and digital sciences, and theology. We seek the connection between different disciplines in order to find solutions to the major issues we face as a society. Our students are trained to be responsible and entrepreneurial thinkers, driven by solidarity, a sense of responsibility and empathy, who are able to influence and give direction to a rapidly changing society in an innovative way. Tilburg University has a culture of collaboration and co-creation, at local, regional, national, and international levels.</p>\n<p>Since its founding in 1963,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/over/schools/law\"><strong>Tilburg Law School</strong></a>\u00a0has become one of the leading law schools in Europe. \u00a0Through top-level research and the provision of high-quality university education, the School contributes to society. Tilburg Law School is organized into five Departments: Public Law and Governance (PLG); Law, Technology and Society (TILT); Private, Business and Labour Law (PBLL); the Fiscal Institute Tilburg (FIT) and Criminal Law. The mission of the School is to understand and improve the role of law and public administration in addressing the social problems of today and tomorrow. Through research and education, our scholars contribute to that mission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More than 4,000 students pursue a Bachelor's, pre-Master's or Master's degree at Tilburg Law School. Through this education, we train students in law, public administration, and data science. The Tilburg Educational Profile (TEP) is unique in the Netherlands. Central to it are three core concepts: knowledge, skill and character. A university education provides students with the latest substantive knowledge and trains them to be critical thinkers and resilient professionals. In addition, the School is committed to innovative educational concepts and, partly in response to the coronavirus crisis, has invested heavily in the quality of online education and in innovative didactic tools to make and keep students inquisitive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tilburg Law School's research is highly regarded nationally and internationally. The Tilburg Law School Departments work closely together in their research in four signature research programs: 1) Global Law and Governance; 2) Law and Security; 3) Connecting Organizations; and 4) Regulating Socio-Technical Change.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Additional information</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>An Internet of Secure Things \u2013 INTERSECT</strong><br/>\nThe Internet-of-Things (IoT), which seamlessly connects the digital and the physical world, is turning out to be one of the weakest spots in the global digital infrastructure. Billions of physical devices with computing and networking capabilities both exacerbate the privacy and security risks of \u2018traditional\u2019 IT settings, and create an entirely new threat surface. A pervasive cyber-physical system of systems, entwined with a myriad of IoT devices, will oversee our lives and economy, while at the same time, from a privacy and security perspective, being completely unmanageable at scale.</p>\n<p>The amount, heterogeneity, and varying longevity of IoT devices challenges conventional information, application, and network security practices. It constitutes a serious threat to our ability to safeguard individuals\u2019 security and safety, on the one hand, and their privacy and data protection rights, on the other hand. IoT devices are different from traditional computing infrastructure in that they are oftentimes dispersed across large geographical areas, even when operated by the same entity, which renders updating and fixing them oftentimes complicated and costly. Their product support lifespan is frequently shorter than the period during which they are used or installed, which results in a plethora of old devices riddled with vulnerabilities and ripe for exploitation deployed in the wild. The IoT category is also extremely heterogeneous and diverse when compared to \u2018traditional\u2019 computing infrastructures: the intermixture of millions of disparate IoT devices and applications, manufactured and managed in countries all over the globe, compounds the challenges of supervising, handling, and controlling the cyber-physical domain.</p>\n<p>The INTERSECT project thus holds that traditional security paradigms, based on targeted solutions developed and deployed specifically for each system, are doomed to eventually fail. Such assessment is compounded by the fact that such a heterogeneous, complex, and globe-spanning environment is easily mismanaged by its human component. The INTERSECT project maintains that, from a technological perspective, there is the need to re-think the security paradigm, delegating part of the security management to the system that needs to autonomously adapt to the changing environment, while remaining under our supervision. When designing or engineering these properties into the devices themselves is not possible, we must be able to resort to other kinds of capabilities, such as the ones deriving from legislation, or from other regulatory and governance instruments.</p>\n<p><strong>Information</strong><br/>\nMore information about the vacancy can be obtained from dr.
