Initial funding for the position is provided for a duration of 3&nbsp;years, further extension is possible.&nbsp;The topicFinite element models for the numerical analysis of large-scale assemblies in the aerospace and automotive industry may comprise hundreds, or even thousands, of joints. In many cases a detailed, fine-scale representation of the connectors and interfaces comprising the joint results in excessive computational and modelling effort. As a remedy, joints are often modelled in an abstracted manner that aims to describe the essential characteristics of the mechanical response in terms of a significantly reduced degree of freedom. Abstract modeling of joints in finite element analysis is a technique widely applied in industrial practice. There, it is typically limited to linear analysis and isotropic materials. The extension of abstract modelling techniques to account for non-linearities resulting from plasticity, damage, friction, and contact is subject of ongoing research. Further challenges arise in the context of anisotropic materials like fiber reinforced composites.TasksThe position offers an interesting research challenge at the interface of fundamental and applied research. The successful candidate will work on extending the state of the art regarding the abstract modelling of various types of joints in fiber reinforced composite assemblies.&nbsp;Employment conditionsFormal requirements include a scientific university degree (master-level) in engineering, or related fields. The successful candidate will be provided with counsel and support, however, the ability for self-motivated and independent work is essential. This task requires a profound background in solid mechanics, computational methods and mechanics of materials. To complement and validate numerical approaches, the successful candidate will also be involved with the design and implementation of experimental investigations. Knowledge concerning technological aspects of composites and practical engineering skills are beneficial. Willingness to support teaching activities is expected. Good English and basic German language skills are required.The salary for the position is according to salary scale 13 TV-L, further information can be found online.&nbsp;Leibniz University Hannover considers itself a family-friendly university and therefore promotes a balance between work and family responsibilities.
