Building on the heritage of the former LTAS (Laboratoire de Techniques A\u00c3\u00a9roSpatiales), it has achieved international recognition for the development of advanced numerical methods and tools and their applications in aerospace engineering. Numerical modeling forms the backbone of A&amp;M research and is effectively complemented by a long expertise in experimental measurements that can leverage state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment. A&amp;M is particularly active in the fields of aerospace engineering, materials and processes, energy conversion, mechanical systems, and biomechanics.</p><p>A&amp;M is committed to the development of multilateral and interdisciplinary scientific collaborations with other academic partners, research institutes and private companies/industries, at both the regional and international levels, to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and to support high level education/training programs.</p><p>The Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge is an applied research centre of the University of Li\u00c3\u00a8ge focusing on the design of space observation instruments. In addition, the CSL has a state-of-the-art environmental test centre serving the European Space Agency (ESA), the space industry and regional companies. The CSL has been contributing to numerous missions to observe the cosmos, the earth and its atmosphere, meteorology, developed largely by ESA and to a lesser extent by NASA. In particular, it has a long-standing expertise in leading the development of space solar instruments, <i>e.g.</i> onboard the SOHO, PROBA2, PROBA-3, and Solar Orbiter missions. The CSL has developed software for satellites equipped with radar, built part of an instrument or been the prime contractor in the construction of an instrument and, in many cases, carried out the very delicate and sometimes very long tests, under space conditions, of many instruments and even entire satellites. Along these missions, the about 100 engineers, physicists and technicians of the Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge have developed a strong expertise in extremely varied fields such as optics, electronics, lasers and non-destructive testing of various materials, thermics, surface analysis and structure, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p>A detailed description of the A&amp;M department, the Centre Spatial de Li\u00c3\u00a8ge, the Royal Observatory of Belgium and their activities can be found on their websites <u>http://www.am.uliege.be</u>, <u>http://www.csl.uliege.be</u>, <u>https://www.astro.oma.be/en/</u>, and <u>http://sidc.be/aboutSIDC</u>.</p><p><strong>Research activities</strong></p><p>The general objective of the FED-tWIN Profile is to conceive the next generation of solar space-borne instrumentation by pioneering new technologies and designs optimized for future solar physics.
