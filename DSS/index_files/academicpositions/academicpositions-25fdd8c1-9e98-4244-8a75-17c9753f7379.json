Our universities community has its competitive edges in technology, health and society. www.tuni.fi/enThe Aerosol Physics Laboratory at the Hervanta campus of Tampere University (formerly Tampere University of Technology) advances multidisciplinary science in the areas of combustion aerosols, atmospheric aerosols, nanoparticle synthesis, nanostructured coatings, and relevant measurement techniques. Our long-term vision involves the implementation of the state-of-the-art on-line mass spectrometric techniques to resolve open questions related to particle formation and chemistry in all of these areas.Job descriptionAerosol Physics lab has 2-4 positions open for master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thesis workers who will work as Research Assistants in different projects. The laboratory focuses on measurement methods for aerosols, particle emissions from vehicles and power production, air quality and atmospheric aerosols. Emission research and atmospheric aerosol research focus especially on the formation of particles, as well as studying particles which have a high health and/or climatic impact. The open positions are related to on-going research projects or new projects beginning in 2022.Some examples of thesis topics are:New measurement methods for indoor aerosols in the context of current pandemicGas-phase aerosol precursor formationSemi-volatile aerosols in emissions and in the atmosphereAdvanced nanoparticle measurement methodsDevelopment of aerosol sensorsVehicle emissions with alternative fuelsNanoparticles in an urban environmentSurface area of lung-depositing particles in living environmentsDetermining the secondary aerosol formation potential of exhaust emissionsThe effect of combustion aerosol sampling on semi-volatile compounds and particle number measurementsBlack carbon emissions and their measurementFormation and structural analysis of carbon nanoparticlesReal particle emissions of road trafficNumerical modelling of factors influencing particle exposure in indoor environmentsThe exact job description will be personalized to fit the candidate and thesis topic. Typically thesis work involves experimental measurements, but it can also involve developing instruments and measurement methods as well as numerical modelling. Work is conducted in active collaboration with other research groups and companies. Travelling may be required. Reporting the research can include other written works in addition to the thesis.RequirementsA major in engineering physics and aerosol physics courses offer a suitable background for applicants to most positions; however, applicants from other majors will also be considered. For example, some combination of physics, chemistry, environmental engineering, programming and energy engineering studies can also form a solid background.Applicants are required to be cooperative team workers.Good academic records can benefit the applicant. Some positions may have the option of continuing work onto a Ph.D.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;be prepared to provide proof of your merits when requested.&nbsp;We offerThe position will be fulltime (possibility to part-time) and it will filled for a fixed-term of 6 to 8 months,&nbsp;a trial period of six months or maximum half of the duration applies to all our new employees. &nbsp;The expected starting date is as soon as possible, as mutually agreed upon by both parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary will be based on both the job demands and the employee's personal performance in accordance with the University Salary System. The position of Research Assistant is placed on the job demand level 1 (the demand level chart for the teaching and research staff). The personal performance portion of the salary for research assistants is based on the number of course credit points.We offer a wide range of staff benefits, such as occupational health care, flexible working hours, excellent sports facilities on campus and several restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s on campus with staff discounts.
