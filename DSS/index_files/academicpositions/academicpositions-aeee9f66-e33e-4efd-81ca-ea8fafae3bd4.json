Neither Lithium-Ion batteries nor hydrogen fuel cells are currently solutions for the power subsystem, either due to the requirement of highly pressurised storage, complex systems or safety. Thus, exploring alternative sustainable fuel cell solutions is crucial to meet future satellite power and propulsion requirements.</p> <p>This research project investigates the applicability of green ethanol fuel cells for satellite power &amp; propulsion systems. The ethanol fuel cell has several advantages over hydrogen fuel cell, including multi-fuel additive capability, storage, and handling safety. It has a five times higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen. The power generated by ethanol with a fuel additive is expected to have comparable performance with hydrogen fuel cells. Although the theoretical efficiency of an ethanol fuel cell is 96%, in practice, at the highest power density, it is much lower for a variety of reasons which demand detailed research.</p> <p>This research project has the following objectives:</p> <p>(1) Design and process optimisation of electrode, and memberane to maximise the power output per volume/surface area, improving reliability and lifetime of subcomponents to improve the overall fuel cell efficiency in the space environment, (2) In depth characterisation of electrode and system performance, and (3) Realisation and demonstration of fuel cell prototype in a lab environment.</p> <p>This project will be carried out within the Space Systems Engineering Section (SSE) of the Department of Space Engineering at Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft Universtity of Technology.</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p>You have an excellent track record from your MSc degree in Mechanical Engineering/Aerospace Engineering/Chemical Engineering/Applied Science/Applied Physics/ Chemistry with a specialisation in energy storage, generation systems, energy/power management, or fuel cell technology.
