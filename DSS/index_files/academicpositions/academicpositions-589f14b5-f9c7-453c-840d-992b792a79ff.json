In this project, focus is on metal AM, for instance by powder bed fusion. For commercially viable products, not only performance and manufacturability but particularly cost is a decisive factor. We consider a setting where many identical components are to be printed. Build time and build chamber utilization are key aspects determining the printing cost, and these depend on component design, orientation, and nesting/stacking. This research aims to develop a TO approach capable of including AM cost estimates, considering the aforementioned aspects. Opportunities exist to fabricate generated use-case designs using metal AM.\u00a0</p>", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p>A completed PhD or Postdoc involving development of TO methods is required, and familiarity with AM is desired.
