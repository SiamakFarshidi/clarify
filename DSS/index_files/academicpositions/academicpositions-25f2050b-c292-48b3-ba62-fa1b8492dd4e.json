This will involve the development of new production routes and processes that have been proven to minimise their environmental footprint through quantified assessment. Bioengineers have a role to play in this transition process as highlighted in the conclusions of our forward-looking workshops dedicated to the challenges facing bioengineers in 2030. This is also reflected in the objectives of Wallonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smart specialisation strategy (Strategic Innovation Areas), which emphasise reducing the energy and environmental impact of its food production. For the bioengineer, the subject is complex because it covers processes from production through to the end of the transformation chain. The evolution of these sectors towards green production by managing assessments, reducing needs and losses (carbon footprint, water costs) and also by increasing value through recycling or recapitalisation must be guided by a quantified scientific evaluation. While many processes related to the production and processing of agricultural products are already studied within the Faculty, a cross-sectional assessment of the environmental balance of the entire value chain is as yet untouched in light of the challenges mentioned above.Teaching activitiesThe teaching activities consist of the introduction of environmental evaluation in courses directly related to components of the water-soil-air continuum and/or involving the use of material and energy resources (e.g. the use of water and energy in the production of electricity):&nbsp;GERE0024-1, Ecosystem-atmosphere exchange under climate change; GERE0034-1, Practical assessment of soil and water resources; GERE0025-1, Digital eco-design; GERE0028-2, Physics of construction and special techniques).&nbsp;Activities also include:A contribution to the course \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntroduction to Environmental Assessment\u00e2\u0080\u009d (ENVT2049-2, two credits) given by a faculty member of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, by providing concrete cases related to the production and processing of agricultural products.&nbsp;Responsibility for the activity \u00e2\u0080\u009cField applications and visits\u00e2\u0080\u009d (two credits) in the Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Bioengineering in environmental sciences and technologies, which should illustrate, through visits to companies and institutions, the notions of reducing the impact of human activity on the environment.Research ActivitiesThe specific research activities of the position will focus on the environmental balance of one or more stages related to the production/processing of agricultural products, namely:Quantify the resources needed and the losses in the different environmental compartments (greenhouse gases or reagents, water, energy);&nbsp;Propose itineraries with a lower impact in light of the most recent knowledge.&nbsp;Integrating results into tools such as Life Cycle Assessment and participating in the development and improvement of these tools.&nbsp;To develop applied research, the successful candidate will draw on the knowledge of other TERRA researchers in the field of environmental exchange and energy management.&nbsp;Services to the CommunityAccording to their skills, the successful candidate will be able to become actively involved in the Faculty Commission for Sustainable Development and to participate in facilitating the VivaSciences and Green Office&nbsp;workshops. They will also be able to take on responsibilities within the Gembloux Campus Sustainability&nbsp;Committee.&nbsp; They will represent the Faculty to institutions and organisations concerned with the environmental impact of agricultural products and will act as the lead spokesperson for the press and general public on this subject.Other community service activities will be determined in consultation with senior staff.Qualifications required / profileMust hold a first degree in agronomic engineering (or bioengineering) or an equivalent Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree and a doctoral research degree with experience in the relevant field;Must demonstrate recognised scientific experience, both in the field and through publications at international level in the relevant field;Must be open-minded to the international world (having completed a scientific stay abroad of at least six months is an advantage);Must be a good teacher (teaching experience is an advantage);Must demonstrate the ability to work on interdisciplinary themes;Must be able to work independently and within a team, using pooled human and material resources within the GxABT facilities, and must have excellent organisational skills and the ability to coordinate technical staff;Must be available for a variety of different roles relating to services to the community and public education;Master French and English (including writing);Must be available for missions abroad;Must subscribe to the general quality objectives developed by the University and the faculty;Upon appointment, the post holder must sign an agreement on the ownership of any research results.Selection&nbsp;procedureAn ad hoc Faculty committee will select the candidates to be interviewed, giving reasons for its decisions in the light of the call for applications and the candidates' qualifications and merits. It will then interview the candidates. The committee will submit to the Faculty Council its reasoned proposal for appointment on the basis of the evaluation of the applications and the interviews.&nbsp;On the basis of the information communicated by the committee and the comparison of the respective publications and merits of the candidates, the Faculty Council shall adopt a reasoned proposal for the appointment or closure of the post, which it transmits to the decision-making bodies of the University of Li\u00c3\u00a8ge.Our institutional policy is based on diversity and equal opportunities.
