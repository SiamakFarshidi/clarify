Our universities community has its competitive edges in technology, health and society. www.tuni.fi/enWe are now seeking a postdoctoral research fellow in Urban PhysicsUrban Physics is a new research area at Tampere University and in Finland. As a postdoctoral research fellow there are unique opportunities to help shape the future of research and teaching in the field in Finland.The Faculty of Built Environment department of Civil Engineering is looking for a postdoctoral research fellow to undertake research in the field of Urban Physics and to support teaching of the technology track of the &nbsp;Sustainable Urban Development (SUD) programme. The new Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Programme in SUD is an international programme that teaches students multidisciplinary expertise related to urban development and sustainability. It consists of three tracks: Administrative Sciences, Social Sciences and Technology.At our faculty we conduct high-quality scientific and applied research in the fields of architecture and civil engineering and provide higher education based on this research. Our unique research environment promotes collaboration and innovations and opens opportunities to pursue new avenues of multidisciplinary research and education. We have strong collaborative networks and offer great opportunities for researchers to develop their careers in an international setting. This includes the Sustainable Transformation of Urban Environments (STUE) profiling area, with significant opportunities to pursue interdisciplinary, impactful research with collaborators within the Tampere University community, as well as across Finland and internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Tampere University, we are working to solve society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major challenges and create new opportunities by linking pioneering research and innovation, promoting interdisciplinary education and life-long partnerships, and generating unique expertise for industrial and public-sector implementation. As set out in our strategy, our mission is to work together to build a sustainable world.Job descriptionThe research responsibilities will be conducted in profiling area of Sustainable Transformation of Urban Environments (STUE) in the field of Urban Physics, or the science and engineering of physical processes in urban areas. Urban physics is an interdisciplinary field addressing societal challenges such as climate change, energy, health, pollution, equity, security, mobility and aging in the context of cities and its implications for human health and well-being, biodiversity, resource flows and climate policy. It refers to the indoor and outdoor urban environment and interconnections at multiple scales (i.e. individual buildings through to building stock, city, regional, national and even global scale).Teaching responsibilities will be related to supporting, delivering and developing interdisciplinary courses in the SUD programme. This will require collaborating closely with teaching staff from the faculties of Built Environment, Social Sciences and Administrative Sciences. In addition, SUD students engage in real-life urban development projects, requiring transdisciplinary collaboration with stakeholders outside of the university. The role also involves course development and administration.RequirementsYou should have a PhD degree in physics, data science, engineering, or a related subject area. You should have experience working in multidisciplinary teams, and the ability to collaborate with researchers and experts from a range of different backgrounds. SUD is an international programme, and research collaborations will be international. Therefore, you should be fluent in spoken and written English, while the ability to speak Finnish is a benefit but not required.&nbsp;You should have good teaching experience, and the willingness to undertake university-provided pedagogical training to further develop your teaching skills. As SUD is a multidiscipline programme, you should have an appreciation for the perspectives and knowledge of academic collaborators from different backgrounds. Teaching will also require a strong understanding of key sustainability issues in the built environment.You should have a demonstrated track record of producing independent research. A strong background in statistics, mathematical modelling and programming is required, as is the ability to work with large amounts of data. The ability to use urban physics-related tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), building physics models, and urban microclimate models is an additional benefit.Tampere University is a unique, multidisciplinary and boldly forward-looking, evolving community.
