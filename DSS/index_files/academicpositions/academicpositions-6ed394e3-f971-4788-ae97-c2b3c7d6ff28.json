A joint-attack is needed including consumption reduction and development of renewable energies\u00a0among which the photovoltaic (PV) solar electricity will play a major role, provided that\u00a0significant progress in terms of efficiency, cost reduction and reliability are achieved. \u00a0Among the mass production of materials used to produce solar cells, single\u00a0or multi-crystalline silicon (Si) ingots still dominate the market. For all fabrication processes without exception, the grain boundaries, dislocations, and impurity contamination control during the solidification step remains a major challenge to improve the electrical properties\u00a0[1].\u00a0Impurities play a major role as they not only modify grain nucleation and competition during solidification\u00a0[2, 3], but they are at the origin and/or interact with structural defects, ultimately degrading the cell conversion efficiency\u00a0[4].\u00a0The furnace environment and crucible are responsible for most of the light impurity contamination and in some cases for metallic impurity contamination. In addition, impurities can be found in the starting feedstock used for PV applications all the more in the case of the research and industry focusing on recycling of solar cells which is fast developing\u00a0[5].\u00a0</p><p>Therefore, a thorough understanding of the crystallization mechanisms, of the formation of defects at different scales (from dislocations to grains) and of the complex interaction between growth defects and impurities is needed to control these phenomena during solidification processes.\u00a0Dislocation dynamics during seed heating (Figure 1.a) or while propagating in the ingot during solidification and dislocation interaction with the solid-liquid interface are\u00a0some of the main issues which are far from being fully understood. Another major\u00a0key-issue is the interaction of\u00a0the grain boundaries with dislocations\u00a0[1] and small angle grain boundaries (SAGBs)\u00a0[6].\u00a0</p><p>Recently the MCA (auto-organised growth microstructures) team has demonstrated the effect of carbon (C) on the final grain structure: it is constituted by a higher proportion of high order twins and of random angle grain boundaries compared to the case of low C contaminated samples. Moreover, local deformations are induced by the presence of silicon carbide precipitates, which are at the origin of SABGs formation (Figure 1.b). However,\u00a0further work is needed to better understand the effect of C and other light impurities on grain nucleation and on the related deformation of the crystal structure. Contamination by silicon nitride is another major subject as it is used as crucible coating in the solidification processes. Its effect on first stages of silicon nucleation\u00a0[7], on grain structure formation, development of structural defects and electrical properties needs to be further studied. As concern metallic impurities,\u00a0no significant effect on the grain structure is evidenced in the presence of Cu although it induces a destabilization of the solid-liquid interface (Figure 1.c).\u00a0Iron is another major metallic impurity that is largely responsible for the red-zone (degraded PV properties) in ingots and which effect on grain formation, solid-liquid interface shape and electrical properties needs to be evaluated in details, and to be compared to the case of Cu contamination.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/s7GHqzr4FU7jl8KYt7ig2yuGGshFLsy7ZMupBDxL.png\"/></figure><p><i>Figure 1. a) In situ X-ray imaging of dislocations in a Si sample during heating. b) Peak position map obtained by RCI (Rocking Curve Imaging) and revealing SAGBs in a Si sample contaminated with C. c) In situ X-ray imaging of the solid-liquid interface of a Si sample contaminated with Cu\u00a0[3].\u00a0</i></p><p>In order to answer to these up-to-date issues, the objective of the PhD research work will be to contribute to the understanding of the growth mechanisms, of the structural defect formation (dislocations, twins,\u00a0SAGBs) and of the interaction of these defects in the presence of relevant impurities selected among light and metallic impurities.\u00a0To reach these objectives, the PhD student will carry-out and analyse, <i>in situ\u00a0</i>and time-resolved experiments in a unique device named GaTSBI (Growth at high Temperature observed by X-ray Synchrotron Beam Imaging) developed by the MCA team and run at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), a large European equipment. GaTSBI is constituted of a high temperature (up to 1800\u00c2\u00b0C) directional solidification furnace coupled to X-ray imaging. The latter allows studying the shape and dynamics of the solid-liquid interface, the formation and developments of structural defects and of the deformation of the crystal structure\u00a0[8] <i>in situ\u00a0</i>during heating of the seeds, solidification and cooling down. The PhD student will also implement <i>ex situ</i> complementary characterisation techniques of the grain structure (EBSD - Electron BackScatter Diffraction), of defects and deformation (RCI-Rocking Curve Imaging\u00a0[9]), of impurities (TEM, SIMS), or of the electrical or PV properties.\u00a0</p><p>The PhD work will be conducted at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr\" target=\"_blank\">IM2NP</a> in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr/equipe-microstructures-de-croissance-auto-organisees-mca\" target=\"_blank\">MCA team\u00a0</a>of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr/departement-structure-et-chimie-des-materiaux\" target=\"_blank\">Mater Department (Structure and chemistry of materials)</a>\u00a0in collaboration with: the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), the MSMP (Mechanics, Surface, Materials and Processes) laboratory and the NTNU (<a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology).\u00a0</a></p><p><u>Funding:</u> Doctoral contract (salary)</p><p><u>Keywords:</u> silicon, photovoltaic, X-ray imaging, solidification, impurities, grain boundaries, dislocations, precipitates, twinning.</p><p><u>References:</u></p><p>[1] G.
