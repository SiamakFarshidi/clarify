The common goal of the SIGNALIFE teams is to study signaling pathways from their architecture to their modulation, in order to understand their role in the development and the functions or dysfunctions of organs and organisms. Various biological models are used, and the applications resulting from basic and translational research include biomedical research, pharmacology, development and agriculture.SIGNALIFE is launching an international call for Chairs of Excellence to recruit scientific leaders who will establish new research groups in each of the SIGNALIFE institutes of biology. For this 2022 call for Chairs of Excellence, positions are open in C3M, iBV and ISA. Applications are open to candidates of any nationality, including researchers with a permanent position in France, but candidates must not be working in a SIGNALIFE laboratory at the time of their application. The proposed project should be ambitious and relate to the Labex scientific axes:&nbsp; Cellular Architecture of Signaling Pathways (axis 1), Plasticity of Signaling (axis 2), Stress Signaling (axis 3), Signaling in Aging and Disease Progression (axis 4) and New principles in Signaling and Applications, possibly in association with Inria (axis 5). The added value of the proposal to the SIGNALIFE network will be an important selection criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The selected scientist will receive a SIGNALIFE starter package (up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac600,000) for up to five years including operating costs (\u00e2\u0082\u00ac100,000) and salaries (group leader/post-doc/PhD student/technician, up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac500,000). He/she will be provided with office and laboratory space (around 50 m2) and will have full access to state-of-the-art technological platforms in the laboratory and available on the campus. He/she will be supported by dedicated university services for short-term lodging upon arrival (Faculty Club), given practical and administrative advice and assistance (Welcome Center) and will receive appropriate help and support to apply for other highly competitive national and European programs and for a French academic research position (if applicable).&nbsp;PROCEDURE TO APPLYApplicants should provide, in a single PDF file (single-spaced, 11-point Arial font):- Name of the applicant, address, email and telephone number, project title, SIGNALIFE scientific axes and laboratory associated with the proposed project- Project abstract (1 page)- Detailed project description (4 pages) including the objectives, the rationale and the methodology, highlighting the novelty, originality and feasibility of the project as well as the added value to the SIGNALIFE network and the host laboratory- Description of past and present research activities (2 pages)- CV (1 page) and list of publications.Applications should be sent no later than March 1st, 2022 to:&nbsp;&nbsp;For ISA : Dr. Philippe Castagnone philippe.castagnone@inrae.frFor C3M&nbsp;: Dr Patrick Auberger Patrick.AUBERGER@univ-cotedazur.frFor iBV&nbsp;: Dr. St\u00c3\u00a9phane Noselli Stephane.NOSELLI@univ-cotedazur.frShortlisted candidates will be invited for an on-site interview&nbsp;", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "Universit\u00c3\u00a9 C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Azur is a large public scientific, cultural and professional institution whose fundamental missions are the higher education of students and professionals, excellence in research, and innovation in the service of all.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIwNjhcLzJkMFwvMDY4MmQwOTVlOGIxY2IyYTI4MzgwNDM2Y2M3NWY0YzAucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
