Its goal is to improve the understanding of these issues by the industry, authorities, users and other interested parties.The Association represents the interests of 40 Companies operating petroleum refineries in the EU. Members account for almost 100% of EU petroleum refining capacity and more than 75% of EU motor fuel retail sales.What do we offer?Open-ended contractAttractive salary and fringe benefitsInternational and dynamic multicultural environmentWhat do we expect from you?&nbsp;The role of the Research Associate combines general duties with responsibilities specific to the field of the Concawe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Low Carbon Pathways programme regarding the integration of low carbon technologies and alternative sustainable feedstocks within the European Refining system (https://www.concawe.eu/low-carbon-pathways/)&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be your activities?General dutiesSupport the development and implementation of the annual technical research plan as agreed with the relevant Joint and Management Groups and the Science Director. The scope of the work will be mainly focused on conducting and/or supervising technology scouting of key low carbon technologies and alternative feedstocks for the refining industry with a significant contribution to the European Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2050 climate ambition targets.Develop an in-depth knowledge of the European and global techno-economic issues related to the transition to a low emissions future of the refining industry sector with special focus on new conversion and GHG mitigation technologies.Together with the SEs, develop the scope, review proposals and manage projects (including cost control) related to the specific research areas.Support the Science Executives and chairs of the Concawe Refining into the Energy Transition Management group (RET MG) in the execution of their responsibilities.Coordinate the STF-3 group (Biofuel availability group) defining the research programme and conducting / leading the agreed projects, in collaboration with the Member Companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experts and the SE RT.Liaise with external consultants in the development of the research programmes.Liaise with Member Companies and external stakeholders and provide written documentation of the resultsReport progress and inform appropriate Management Groups, Science Committee as appropriate on his/her activities.Assist in the writing and editing of Concawe technical reports, briefing papers, articles etc., on topics related to the field of activity.Participate in international scientific conferences and develop networkComply with the governance rules of the Association and ensure that the STFs are aware of these rules.Specific research programmes and responsibilitiesThis Research Associate position will focus on the following main tasks, each of which is relevant to the others:1) Low Carbon Technologies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Technology ScoutingImproving the scientific understanding on the opportunities and challenges for different low-carbon technologies and feedstocks to achieve a significant reduction of the CO2 emissions associated with both the manufacturing and use of refined products in Europe in the medium (2030) and longer-term (2050) by:Supporting both SE RT and SE RE in conducting specific technical deep-dives on key low carbon technologies and fuels identified under the scope of the LCP project.Conducting and/or coordinate techno-economic analysis on relevant technologies, including the assessment of their technology readiness level, potential scale-up and the CO2 abatement cost comparison of different options (conducted internally within the Concawe Secretariat and/or in collaboration with external consultants/contractors as deemed appropriated).Liaising with SE RT and SE RE in assessing the potential impact of future legislation in the energy, transport and refining sector when different uptake of future low carbon fuels and GHG mitigation technologies are considered.Supporting the SE RT in the FuelsEurope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related tasks contributing to improve the understanding of existing and future challenges linked to their Clean Fuels For All strategy.Being responsible for drafting and / or contributing to relevant scientific publications and articles to disseminate the results of the Concawe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis in the subject.2) Integration of Low Carbon Technologies into the EU Refining systemCollaborate with the Concawe STF-2 (Refining Technology Task Force) to support specific analysis on the future integration of low carbon technologies into the refining sector.In this context, the SA LCP will explore and support the integration of the low carbon technologies and feedstocks identified into the Concawe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EU refining model, in collaboration with the Science Executive Lineal Programming modelling and other potential external consultants.Be responsible for drafting and / or contributing to relevant scientific publications to disseminate the results of the assessment / modelling work.3) Low Carbon sustainable feedstocks: Availability and SustainabilityAlternative low carbon feedstocks will play a key role, progressively replacing oil in the transition towards 2050. Thesealternative feedstocks will included, among others, biomass residues and waste materials.The SA will contribute to gain understanding on the following issues:Potential sustainable availability of different type of feedstocks for fuel and petrochemical products and current/future R&amp;D needs.Sustainability and biodiversity impactsTechnical implication of related RED II and other pieces of legislation.Opportunities and challenges for the supply chain development, in a potential cross-sectorial collaboration with other Research Centres, Universities or scientific associations.This third activity will be coordinated and supervised within the Concawe STF-3 task force, under the responsibility of the Science Associate Low Carbon Pathways (supervised by SE EM). This analysis will be complemented with an in-depth analysis of electrification and CO2 as feedstock for the production of Power-To-Fuels (e-fuels).As with the other tasks, the SA will be responsible for drafting and / or contributing to relevant scientific publications to disseminate the results of the assessments and/or modelling work conducted during the execution of the research plan.", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "Concawe was established in 1963 by a small group of leading oil companies to carry out research on environmental issues relevant to the oil industry.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiJkOTVcL2QwM1wvZDk1ZDAzOGJmMDA5MzUyZTg2NWIwYTRmMjYxY2RlZWUuanBlZyIsImVkaXRzIjpbXX0="}
