The position is affiliated with the research group Stem Cells, Ageing and Cancer (SAC).The position is a fixed term position for a duration of three years. Appointment to the position of Postdoctoral Research Fellow is mainly intended to provide qualification for work in top academic positions. It is a prerequisite that the applicant can carry out the project over the full course of the employment period. No person may hold more than one fixed term position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the same institution.The position can&nbsp;additionally be assigned to teaching and related work for UiT in an amount equivalent to a maximum 10&nbsp;% of a full-time employment.The workplace is at UiT in Troms\u00c3\u00b8. You must be able to start in the position within a reasonable time after receiving the offer.Unless special circumstances indicate otherwise, postdoctoral projects shall be planned with stays abroad. The duration should be at least 6 months.Department of Medical BiologyMore than 200 staff members from all over the world have their workplace at the Department of Medical Biology (IMB). The department consists of 13 research groups concentrating on fundamental biomedical research problems, including research on various cancer forms, cardiovascular diseases, the body's immune system and antibiotic resistance. The department is also involved in marine bio-prospecting and testing of new drugs.IMB provides education for students studying medicine, dentistry, biomedical laboratory sciences, biomedicine and pharmacy.The position is organized within the recently reappointed Stem Cells, Ageing and Cancer Research Group (SAC). The group aims at understanding malignant haematopoietic stem cell behaviour and regulation. Our goal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets of potential clinical interest. We use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including novel mouse genetic tools, stem cells, omics and advanced imaging. Our group has a broad international network and strengthens translational research through established collaborations with the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN).The position's field of researchAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly aggressive haematopoietic malignancy often associated with poor response to chemotherapy and outcome. Our recent work shows that the anti-inflammatory properties of the stem cell and its niche are low in AML, and this may contribute to the origin or progression of malignancy in both in vivo models and patients. In a follow-up project, the successful candidate will contribute now to understand the molecular (genetic/epigenetic) mechanisms underlying the process of HSC malignant transformation, aiming at using this knowledge for better patient treatment. Further project details will be directly discussed with the applicants.The successful applicant may contribute to the Department's teaching activities (up to 10% of the time). Teaching duties will be allocated based on the applicant's qualifications and the needs of the Department, and may include exam work, teaching seminars, and supervising or assisting in lab courses.You must submit a description&nbsp;of your past research project(s) and its relevance to the advertised position (maximum 2 pages).It is expected that the successful candidate shall prepare progress reports some months after commencing employment, and thereafter on a regular basis.
