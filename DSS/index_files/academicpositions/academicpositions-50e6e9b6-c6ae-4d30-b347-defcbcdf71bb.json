The aim of the RECALL project is to selectively recover critical metals and to valorize the iron in bauxite residues with the overall goal of reducing the pressure on natural mineral resources. A shortage of these materials could be a potential bottleneck to the deployment of a number of strategic technologies including electronic and renewable energies that contain a large number of critical metals including Rare Earth Elements (REEs).</p><p>To reduce the environmental footprint of the extractions, this interdisciplinary project will develop two sustainable processes as an alternative to traditional pyro- and hydrometallurgy processes and will value the economic impact of this technological change in terms of social welfare in which potential environmental and health impacts will be considered.</p><p>The PhD student will work in interaction with (and benefit from) another PhD fellow (AMIDEX - Aix-Marseille University foundation) started in June 2020 and working on the extraction of critical metals from bauxite residue at CEREGE.</p><ul><li><strong>QUALIFICATIONS/SKILLS/EDUCATION &amp; RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS</strong></li></ul><p>Candidates should have a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in economics or environmental sciences, with a strong theoretical background and training in quantitative and statistical techniques.
