Every year 500 new ILD-patients are diagnosed at Erasmus MC. Overall median ILD survival is poor ranging from 5 to 14 years. A recent landmark study demonstrated a reduction in ILD disease progression using costly anti-fibrotic drugs. However, half ILD-patients do not benefit from these expensive anti-fibrotic drugs, but could be better treated with anti-inflammatory or combined treatment. Hence, there is an unmet need for a monitoring tool to phenotype ILD-patients by assessing the amount of pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation to guide treatment choices and monitor response.<br><br>Current monitoring, namely computed tomography and lung function tests cannot differentiate between fibrotic lung disease and active inflammation. Chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can offer a one-stop-shop solution for ILD providing structural and functional information in a single examination, such as ventilation inflammation perfusion and structure (VIPS-MRI).<br><br>The aim of this clinical project is to develop an innovative MRI technology for effective phenotyping, patient-tailored treatment guiding and monitoring of therapy response in ILD-patients through the quantification of both fibrosis and inflammation. A novel imaging chest-MRI protocol will be developed and compared to positron emission tomography MRI (PET-MRI) to quantify inflammation and fibrosis. Dedicated post-processing tools for advanced imaging analysis of chest-MRI will be developed. The PhD student will design the new MRI protocol and execute studies on patients with ILD. The PhD will also develop the needed advanced post-processing tools to quantify fibrosis and inflammation on MR images.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<ul>\n<li>You are a highly motivated candidate with a university MSc degree in Physics, Engineering or Computer Science.</li>\n<li>You have outstanding theoretical and experimental research skills, are well organized and result-driven with a strong team spirit.</li>\n<li>You have strong written and oral English skills (EUR requirements minimum IELTS overall score of 7.0, [comparable to TOEFL PBT: 600; TOEFL CBT: 250; TOEFL IBT: 95]).</li>\n<li>You have received excellent scientific training in the field of physics, computer science (Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch), electric engineering or a related field.</li>\n<li>As you will have patient contact knowledge of basic Dutch is a prerequisite.
