Position opened until filledThe aim of the INFOCONFIN project is to explain the use of an extreme instrument by the Belgian government in its fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Summary of the research project:&nbsp;The INFOCONFIN project studies the information used by the Belgian Government in their decisions to contain the population. It aims to contribute to the theories of policy instrument choice, as none of the established theories alone can explain why governments adopted such an extreme instrument to achieve their goals to control the pandemic situation. To do so, its analytical framework combines theories on the politics of information, (scientific) knowledge utilization, and policy advice. The dependent variable is the decision to contain, leaving aside all other decisions related to pandemic management (subsidies, closure requirements, etc.). With the containment, we isolate an extreme instrument that has been used by governments only on rare occasions. On what basis have governments taken this decision? How did they build their conviction that they chose the right option? How did they legitimize this decision? A case study will be conducted on the basis of a systematic data collection and a mixed method of quantitative and textual analyses. The aim will be to verify whether the choice to confine is based on at least one of the following three conditions: (a) the government capacity to produce and process information; (b) an instrumental use of scientific knowledge coupled with a shared belief within the subsystem; and (c) trust in public agencies and expert groups. Although autonomous, the INFOCONFIN project is part of an international comparison with Quebec (Eric Montpetit, Montreal), Switzerland (Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Varone, Geneva),&nbsp;Australia (Erik Baekkeskov, Melbourne), and Sweden (PerOla \u00c3\u0096berg, Uppsala).Job description:The doctoral researcher will work at UCLouvain under the direction of Prof. David Aubin.
