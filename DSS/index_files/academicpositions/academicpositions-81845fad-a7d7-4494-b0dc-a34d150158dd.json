It is an original \"process\" type approach in the scientific and industrial \"materials\" community. It calls on complementary skills in the fields of thermochemistry, heat-mass transport phenomena, fluid mechanics and numerical simulation techniques. A large part of these studies is carried out in collaboration with industrial users of pyrometallurgical production processes.</p><p>In 2019, the team hosted the industrial chair Liquid Metal, co-financed by the Metropole du Grand Nancy, the University of Lorraine, the CNRS and five industrial sponsors (Arcelor Mittal, Aperam, Aubert &amp; Duval, Safran, Vallourec). It was created within the framework of the \"Metallurgy\" Scientific Interest Group in order to strengthen France's potential in this field for a period of 5 years until December 2023.</p><p><strong>Application</strong></p><p>Applicants are invited to send a r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 and cover letter to:</p><p><a href=\"mailto:thibault.quatravaux@univ-lorraine.fr\">thibault.quatravaux@univ-lorraine.fr</a></p>\n</div>", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "N/A", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDEzXC8xMlwvbG9ycmFpbmUucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
