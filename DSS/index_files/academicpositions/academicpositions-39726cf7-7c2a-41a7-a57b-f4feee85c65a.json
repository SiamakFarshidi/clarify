Our universities community has its competitive edges in technology, health and society. www.tuni.fi/enRadical Aerosol Physical Chemistry group of the Physics unit&nbsp;at the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences is looking for highly-motivated Doctoral Researchers. Our group concentrates on molecular level processes of atmospheric pollutant formation and removal, especially the rapid gas-phase generation of sticky molecules that form the atmospheric particulate matter - the leading cause of premature mortality around the globe. As importantly, we develop research methods that allow evermore deeper insight into the underlying chemistry &amp; physics, most crucially atmospheric pressure, controlled, chemical ionization mass spectrometry.&nbsp;Job description&nbsp;We are looking for 3 Doctoral Researchers in the area of atmospheric chemistry and aerosol physics. The work is conducted as a part of an international research team and the main working language in the group is English. The research is closely related to both the Finnish Academy Center of Excellence and European Research Council research applying and developing state-of-the-art research methodologies. Successful candidates will pursue a doctoral degree at Tampere University. Full-time doctoral studies are expected to be completed in four years.&nbsp;Depending on your experience and interests, you will start working in one of the following fields:&nbsp;Experimental and/or theoretical investigations of rapid hydrocarbon oxidation (e.g., air pollutant and particulate matter formation)Theoretical investigations of ion-molecule reactions (e.g., chemical ionization mass spectrometry)Experimental investigations of evaporation &amp; condensation dependence on molecular structureThe actual work could be a composite of the above and constitute both theory and experiments. The specific topic of the thesis project can be decided after the initiation period.&nbsp;Requirements&nbsp;A Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in physics, chemistry or a related field and have demonstrated (during your studies towards the Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree or otherwise) the competence and motivation to pursue postgraduate studies. Please be prepared to provide proof of your merits when requested.&nbsp;Successful candidates must be pursuing or will be accepted to study towards a doctoral degree in the doctoral programme of the discipline. Please visit the admissions webpage https://www.tuni.fi/en/study-with-us/programmes/doctoral-programmes for more information on eligibility requirements.&nbsp;Preliminary experience with mass spectrometric methods, flow reactor experiments and theoretical modelling can help but are not necessary for the positions.&nbsp;Candidates are selected based on the level of promise that they show, and this will be evaluated on the basis of their study and research plans, their previous success in studies, and merits in scientific publishing.&nbsp;We offer&nbsp;The position will be filled for a fixed-term period of maximum four (4) years. The starting date is June 1st 2022 or as mutually agreed. A trial period of six (6) months applies to all our new employees.&nbsp;The salary will be based on both the job requirements and the employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal performance in accordance with the salary system of Finnish universities. According to the criteria applied to teaching and research staff, the position of a Doctoral Researcher is placed on level 2\u00e2\u0080\u00944 of the job requirements scale. A typical starting salary for Doctoral Researchers is around 2400 - 2500 EUR/month.&nbsp;We offer a wide range of staff benefits, such as occupational health care, flexible working hours, excellent sports facilities on campus and several restaurants and caf\u00c3\u00a9s on campus with staff discounts. Please read more about working at Tampere University. We are inviting you to be a part of a vibrant, active and truly international research community. We value interdisciplinarity, as it allows you to expand your research network and exposes you to new perspectives and ideas to solve complex research problems and pursue novel research findings.
