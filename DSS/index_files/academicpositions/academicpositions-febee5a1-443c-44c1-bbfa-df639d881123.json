The position is within the Norwegian Research Council Long-term research project \"Collective Efficient Deep Learning and Networked Control for Multiple Collaborative Robot Systems (DEEPCOBOT)\". The position is located at Campus Grimstad and will be shared among the Department of Engineering Sciences (50%) and the Department of Information and Communication Technology (50%), for a period of two years. The start date is negotiable with the Faculty.The overall goal of the DEEPCOBOT project is the design of a new generation of decentralized data-driven deep learning-based controllers for multiple coexisting collaborative robots (cobots), which can interact both between themselves and with human operators in order to collectively learn from each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experiences and perform cooperatively different complex tasks in a large-scale industrial process environment. The project is motivated by the increasing demand of automation in industry, especially the demand of a safer, more intuitive, more comfortable and more efficient collaboration between multiple cobots and human operators to integrate the best of human abilities (creativity, adaptivity, interaction) and robotic automation (speed, reliability, precision and inexhaustible task execution capability), while being robust across different environments and human operators. This project will lead to several important advances in the areas of machine learning, decentralized control for cobots, graph signal processing, design of cross-layer network protocols for distributed computation and collective intelligence across multiple cobots.The position will cover theoretical advancements, algorithm design, as well as simulation and experimental evaluation, on two of the following research topics:1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep learning algorithms for the cobots to infer and predict the motion of human operators interacting with them, including also interpretable, active and transfer learning methods to speed up the learning process and the corresponding shared control strategies guiding the interaction between the cobot and human operators.2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decentralized local controllers at the cobots using the reinforcement learning framework, where each cobot learns both from its local information and from other information about other cobots\u00e2\u0080\u0099 learning process in the neighborhood.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graph signal processing algorithms, graph neural networks and cross-layer network protocols to provide the required diffusion of information across the cobots so that both the deep learning process is efficient and stable, and the testing running phase is also executed correctly, satisfying the real-time and safety constraints, and minimizing energy consumption.The project will be integrated in two Centers at UiA, namely, the Top Priority Research Center of Mechatronics and the NFR-Toppforsk funded WISENET Center at UiA, where the Post-Doctoral Research Fellow will benefit intellectually from the interaction with internationally recognized researchers, well-equipped environments and will build on and strengthen the established cooperation in AI, Machine Learning, industrial robotics, and autonomous networked cyber-physical systems with industry partners, such as ABB Norway, Mechatronics Innovation Lab (MIL), Omron Electronics Norway, and international partners including University of California San Diego (USA), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) and the University of Navarra (Spain). The project will give also the opportunity to pay extended visits to Universities in USA, Sweden and Spain. The&nbsp;robots&nbsp;used in this project&nbsp;are TIAGo robot, UR5 cobot, and ABB Yumi cobot.Required qualificationsTo be regarded as an eligible applicant, the candidates must have:A PhD in either Robotics, ICT, Mechatronics, Control, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or other related disciplines.
