The group is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iop.uva.nl/content/research-groups/qgqi/quantum-gases-quantum-information.html\">Quantum Gases and Quantum Information</a>&nbsp;(QGQI) cluster at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). We study trapped ions immersed in ultracold atoms and are especially focusing on quantum effects. These systems are both interesting from the quantum chemistry aspect as well as for emerging quantum applications, such as quantum computing and simulation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are you going to do?</strong></p><p>You will:</p><ul> <li>work in an optical laboratory and advance the experimental setup that studies interactions between a trapped ion impurity and an ultracold gas of atoms. The work will involve setting up optics, lasers and electronics as well as, programming, scientific reporting and data measuring and analysis;</li> <li>prepare a single trapped Yb++ ion as impurity, immersed in a bath of ultracold Li atoms and study the quantum dynamics of the ion in the bath, as well as the chemical reactions that can occur in it. The interactions and statistics of the bath can be controlled via external fields. An impurity interacting with a quantum bath is a nontrivial many-body model system with broad relevance to condensed matter. These systems could shed light on the fuzzy boundary between classical and quantum physics and may prove to be of fundamental importance when considering the practical applicability of quantum technology such as quantum computers;</li> <li>work in a team with another PhD student, a post doc and several Master students.
