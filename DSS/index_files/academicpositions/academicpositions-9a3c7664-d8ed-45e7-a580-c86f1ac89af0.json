The principal objective of the PhD is to investigate the mechanisms and factors implicated in intestinal barrier disruption (e.g. microbial, epithelial and immune dysfunctions) linked to the development of alcohol-associated liver disease in humans. The project is translational in nature in continuity with our previous work on the topic and takes a primarily a bedside to bench approach. This implies working with patients hospitalized in a dedicated alcohol withdrawal unit as well as in vitro and animal studies in the laboratory to support and clarify findings in the patient population.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONBenefitsA stimulating, internationally recognized research environmentHigh quality international collaborationsA location close to an international city center with multiple social and cultural activitiesA 4 years PhD fellowship with a salary in accordance to standard Belgian regulationsAvailability: immediateSelection process- pre-selection based on the provided application documents- online interview of the pre-selected candidates-&nbsp; final selection&nbsp;following a personal interview on siteAdditional commentsLocation:The research group is located in the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research (IREC) of the UCLouvain, Universit\u00c3\u00a9 Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain, Belgium) situated on the Brussels Campus close to the St. Luc University Hospital where the alcohol withdrawal unit is established.Contact:Prof. Peter St\u00c3\u00a4rkelLaboratory of Hepato-gastroenterology (GAEN), Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research (IREC), UCLouvain, Brussels, BelgiumDepartment of Hepato-Gastroenterology, St. University Hospital, Brussels, BelgiumTel: +32 2 7642853; Email: peter.starkel@saintluc.uclouvain.beREQUIREMENTSOffer RequirementsREQUIRED EDUCATION LEVELBiological sciences: Master Degree or equivalentPharmacological sciences: Master Degree or equivalentMedical sciences: Master Degree or equivalentEngineering: Master Degree or equivalentREQUIRED LANGUAGESFRENCH: BasicSkills/Qualificationscandidates holding a master degree in bioengineering sciences might be eligibleGood knowledge of the English languageknowledge of French constitutes an additional advantageFlexibility and a good capacity to integrate/work in a multidisciplinary research teamknowledge of basic informatics toolsSpecific RequirementsApplication/documents:In French or English to be sent by e-mail to: peter.starkel@saintluc.uclouvain.beCurriculum vitaeDetailed academic results (with a publication list if applicable)A cover letter explaining the research motivationThe names and details of two potential references", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "The Universit\u00c3\u00a9 catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) is internationally recognized for research and teaching quality in many different fields of expertise.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiJjMzlcLzYyNVwvYzM5NjI1NmU5NTg5YjI4MzIzZjU2YzY4MjE3NTU1NWUucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
