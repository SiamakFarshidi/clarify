He is one of the Hector Fellows, a community of outstanding professors from different research institutions across Germany working in STEM-subjects, medicine, and psychology.He is one of the world's leading experts on the mechanisms of gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. He resolved the three-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase II, discovered mechanisms underlying gene regulation at the origin of genes and developed methods to track the metabolism of mRNA in cells. More recently, he is working on the development of methods to visualize and functionally analyze the transcription of a natural DNA template called chromatin.Your profileYou are enthusiastic about developing and investigating an innovative research idea within the discipline of Prof. Cramer.&nbsp;You have a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in a scientific or engineering subject with excellent grades.&nbsp;Our offerOpportunity to realize a self-developed research ideaMentored by an internationally renowned, top-level scientistFunded position (according to TV-L 13, up to 100%, based on the funding rates of the DFG for PhD students)Extensive research fundingMembership in an excellent research networkAdditional management courses, trainings &amp; networking eventsYour applicationApply until March 31st, 2022&nbsp; via our Application Portal.Further information: www.hector-fellow-academy.de", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "The Hector Fellow Academy (HFA) is a young science academy offering a platform for interdisciplinary exchange to outstanding researchers.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiI1ZmFcL2I0YVwvNWZhYjRhMTZkNmI2MTBkZGQxMTNlZjdhODEyYWMxNTYucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
