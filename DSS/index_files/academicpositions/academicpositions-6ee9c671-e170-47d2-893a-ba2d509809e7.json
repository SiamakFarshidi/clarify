More information for the new call-out will come up in Autumn 2022. Stay tuned!</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://imprs-brain-behavior.mpg.de/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Brain and Behavior</strong></a> is a fully-funded PhD program in Bonn, Germany that offers a competitive world-class PhD program in the field of neuroethology. IMPRS for Brain &amp; Behavior is a collaboration between <a href=\"https://www.caesar.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>research center caesar</strong></a> (a neuroethology institute of the Max Planck Society), the <a href=\"https://www.uni-bonn.de/en\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>University of Bonn</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.dzne.de/en/about-us/sites/bonn/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease (DZNE) in Bonn</strong></a>.</p><p>We offer an exciting opportunity to outstanding Master's degree holders (or equivalent) from a relevant field (life sciences, mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, etc.) (or Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in medicine) to be immersed in a stimulating environment.</p><p>To gain a full understanding of brain circuitry underlying a specific behavior requires the combination of research approaches focusing on different levels of detail - ranging from the anatomical reconstruction of neural circuits to the quantitative behavioral analysis of freely moving animals and natural behavior. The IMPRS for Brain and Behavior is unique and distinguishes itself from other graduate schools in the field of neuroscience by focusing its efforts on providing theoretical and methodological training in neuroethology and modern neuroscience methods.</p><p><img alt=\"IMPRS%20BB%20photo%202021\" class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://cdn.academicpositions.com/gallery/IMPRS%20BB%20photo%202021.jpeg\" style=\"width:600px;\"/></p><p>IMPRS for Brain and Behavior has 20 research groups with an enormous variety of research projects being carried out. Successful candidates can choose to do lab rotations in the first six months of their PhD.</p><p>Doctoral candidates receive both theoretical training and hands-on training in a large range of cutting-edge techniques. In addition, they are exposed to a variety of research areas all touching on how sensory information is encoded in neural circuits and is ultimately transferred to behavior.</p><p>Application period begins on 1 September.\u00a0</p><p>Successful candidates will be invited to attend an online selection symposium in February 2022, which provides the opportunity to meet with faculty members and current PhD students.</p><p><strong>How to apply</strong></p><p>Please apply online at <a href=\"https://imprs-brain-behavior.mpg.de/\" target=\"_blank\">https://imprs-brain-behavior.mpg.de/</a>.</p><p><strong><u>Follow us on social media!</u></strong></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IMPRSBrainBehavior/?ref=bookmarks\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/IMPRSBrainBehavior/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IMPRSBrainBehav\" target=\"_blank\">@IMPRSBrainBehav</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imprs.brain.behavior/\" target=\"_blank\">imprs.brain.behavior</a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/imprs-for-brain-and-behavior/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/imprs-for-brain-and-behavior/</a></p>\n</div>", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "N/A", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDE1XC8xMVwvaW1wcnMtYnJhaW4tYmVoYXZpb3VyLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjpbXX0="}
