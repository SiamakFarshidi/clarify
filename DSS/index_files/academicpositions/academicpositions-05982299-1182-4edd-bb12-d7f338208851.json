The department currently has more than 130 scientific staff, 15 administrative staff, and 1300 students.<br/>Our research is recognised internationally and nationally to be at the highest level of excellence according to community standards, prioritizing quality over quantity. We balance applications and theory, and societal and scientific impact, applying research to solve real-world problems, while also conducting foundational research with potential long-term impact. As part of this, we are acknowledged and respected for close collaboration with industry and for applying research to create impact and value for society, in particular within the area of sustainable development.<br/>Our educations are problem-based and recognised for producing highly skilled graduates with very high employability, who are experienced with project work on solving real-world problems in diverse teams and able to think critically about the technologies they develop. In the workplace, we strive for diversity in nationality, culture, and gender, success as a team effort, maintaining an inspiring physical work environment, and ensuring a good work-life balance.<br/>Over the last two years, the department has grown over 35% in scientific staff, hiring more than 25 assistant/associate professors and 7 full professors. This expansion is fueled by the success of our educations and our steady growth in externally funded research projects.<br/>In 2020 we have established a new unit on Aalborg University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Campus in Copenhagen, responsible for establishing a new bachelor's and master's educations in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftware\u00e2\u0080\u009d.
