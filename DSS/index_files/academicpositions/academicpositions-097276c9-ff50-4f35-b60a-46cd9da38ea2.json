While the obesogenic environment has contributed to increased obesity rates, genetic factors modulate the susceptibility for obesity. Our research within the Obesity Center CGG (Centrum Gezond Gewicht) shows that obese patients frequently harbor genetic mutations or variants as an underlying cause of their obesity. Studies show that common polymorphisms in genes implicated in severe obesity modulate body mass index (BMI) and the risk for obesity in the general population.<br><br>In this project we aim to analyze the association of variants of genes involved in the leptin-melanocortin system and novel identified obesity-related pathways with BMI and obesity-related health issues (such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease) using population-based cohorts and translate results to our clinical obesity cohort.", "requirements_description": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Requirements</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n    For this position we are seeking a highly motivated candidate with an MSc in Biology, Biomedical Sciences or a related discipline with an interest in Endocrinology and Obesity.

Our main mission is to pioneer innovation in research, education and care by bringing science to the patient. To achieve this objective, we aim to continually develop new technologies and innovations within the department in research, education and care.<br/><br/>Within the section Endocrinology, the research group \"Metabolism and Reproduction\" focuses on aspects of sex differences in metabolism in health and disease. We approach our research questions using genetic, physiological and cellular techniques, both in animal models and in humans. An important principle that guides our efforts is the possibility to apply our findings to the clinic and, vice versa, paying attention to questions that arise in the clinic when treating patients. You will be working in a multi-disciplinary dynamic environment. For this project, you will collaborate closely with researchers of the team of Prof. J. van Meurs.\n              \n            \n  </div>\n</div>", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Additional information</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n    For more information about this position, please contact Dr. ir.
