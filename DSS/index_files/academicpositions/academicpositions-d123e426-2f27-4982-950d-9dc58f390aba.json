In cooperation with virtually all technical sciences imaginable on campus, we realise excellent research results to improve lives and tackle social challenges.</p> <p>The faculty focusses its research on three areas of application, i.e. Health, Mobility and Sustainability. This includes, for example, the facilitation of home care through robotics-driven applications as well as system-level designs that contribute to faster baggage handling at airports. Or, for example, the integration of sustainability in designs, in light of future resource scarcity. Click <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/io/onderzoek\">here</a> for an overview of these fields and examples of research projects:</p> <p>Bearing final responsibility for research, education and operations at the faculty, you will outline the main path and manage the faculty at an operational level. You do so through unifying leadership, an open-minded stance towards cultural differences and a keen eye for diversity and talent. You also contribute to effective cooperation within the faculty, with other faculties of TU Delft and with the (inter)national design domain. Your management team is currently working on the strategic plan for the faculty's research in coming years. You will carry out this plan and ensure its concrete implementation. To the outside world, you act as an ambassador for research and education within our faculty.</p> <p>As dean, you are the chair of the management team, which consists, among others, of three departmental chairpersons, the representatives of the research council, the educational director, the HR, finance and communication managers and the secretary. With them, you enhance the faculty's research vision, mission and strategy and create a stimulating environment for excellent research. You also represent the faculty in the TU Delft group council which you are part of along with the Executive Board and the deans of the other seven faculties.
