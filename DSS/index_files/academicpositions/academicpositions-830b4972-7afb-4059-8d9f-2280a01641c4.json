This track allows PhD candidates to write a PhD dissertation while in employment. Among others, our current \"on-the-job\" PhD candidates hold positions at UN, IMF, INSEE or Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse. The objective of candidates enrolled in this Program is to quickly and successfully achieve high quality academic research that is of interest for their professional career. The standard duration of the PhD is 4 years.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As for the classic track, \"on-the-job\" PhD candidates work under the (co-)supervision of one or two AMSE faculty members. At the end of the first year, the PhD candidate and the supervisor(s) set up a thesis committee which consists of two other researchers, one from AMSE and one external to AMSE. The committee provides additional feedback on the thesis, in particular during the second-year defense, in which it evaluates the progress made in the first couple of years and gives advices for the second part of the PhD.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"On-the-job\" PhD candidates must spend at least one two (not necessarily consecutive) full week per academic year our Aix-en-Provence or Marseille premises, to meet and work with their advisor(s) and meet other AMSE candidates. They must also present their work once per year at the AMSE PhD seminar. These presentations can take place online.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pre-defense is generally organized around four months before the final defense. The jury is the same at the final defense\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jury, and the entire PhD dissertation is defended behind closed doors. The student can then bring the necessary changes to the thesis before the final, public defense takes place at the end of the fourth year.</p><ul><li><strong>QUALIFICATIONS/SKILLS/EDUCATION &amp; RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS</strong></li></ul><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A completed research-oriented Master's degree + being an in-service training candidate</p><ul><li><strong>APPLICATION DEADLINE\u00a0</strong></li></ul><p>Applications will be considered all year round -\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/sites/default/files/enseignement/poster_amse_phd_program_on_the_job_2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">application guidelines</a></p><ul><li><strong>STARTING DATE\u00a0</strong></li></ul><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 September 2022</p><ul><li><strong>JOB LOCATION</strong></li></ul><p>NA</p><ul><li><strong>REQUESTED DOCUMENTS OF APPLICATION</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Application procedure</strong></p><p>Step 1 - Pre-application</p><ul><li>A detailed curriculum vitae (if the applicant does not hold a master degree in economics, she/he must provide all documents that justify her/his qualification for doing a PhD in economics).</li><li>A cover letter.</li><li>Proofs of employment status.</li><li>A short research project (max 8 pages).</li><li>Detailed transcripts of master-level grades.</li><li>Letter of support by the applicant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employer.</li><li>Two reference letters.</li></ul><p>All documents need to be sent to the AMSE PhD program secretariat in PDF format.
