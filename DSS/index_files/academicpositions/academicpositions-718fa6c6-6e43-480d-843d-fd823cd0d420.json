Microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) constitute an alternative platform to femtosecond mode-locked lasers for realizing frequency combs on a chip scale. Their compactness, compatibility with standard semiconductor fabrication techniques and large (&gt; 10 GHz) line spacing enable new opportunities in frequency synthesis and metrology: from advanced communications to radio-frequency photonics.</p><p>In the past years, our group has demonstrated microcombs based on silicon nitride with outstanding performance in terms of conversion efficiency. We have shown the potential of these light sources in the context of coherent optical communications and explored nonlinear physics in an arrangement of linearly coupled cavities. We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join our team and investigate new research avenues based on this platform, comprising the exploration of different operational wavelengths for optical spectroscopy, the realization of phase-coherent light wave communications or the synthesis of high-frequency microwaves. The research project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Swedish Research Council (VR).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mc2/laboratories/PL/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Photonics laboratory</strong></a> at <a href=\"https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mc2/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>the Microtechnology and Nanoscience Department</strong></a> (MC2) is a dynamic and creative group with about 30 members working in an international and collaborative atmosphere.
