The Inria Center is a major and recognized player in the field of digital sciences. It is at the heart of a rich R&amp;D and innovation ecosystem: highly innovative PMEs, large industrial groups, competitiveness clusters, research and higher education players, laboratories of excellence, technological research institute, etc</p><h4>Context</h4><p>Food industry concentrates a quarter of the recognized work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in France. In such an industry, workers are particularly exposed to physical risk factors (cold, repetitive tasks, heavy loads\u00e2\u0080\u00a6), due to the lack of automatization of strenuous tasks. Among all, cutting/deboning tasks in meat industry are particularly prone to injuries and focus a lot of ergonomic interventions. The industrial project in which this position is funded aims at developing and commercializing a wrist exoskeleton able to assist butchers in the realization of such tasks to minimize their exposure to physical risks of WMSD development. The exoskeleton is actuated with artificial muscles, able to provide a compliant force assistance to the task to be performed. From an initial prototype that served as a proof of concept, the project is developing a fully operational product.</p><p>The project is leaded by a R&amp;D company specialized in the food industry, in charge of the development of the exoskeleton, with in coordination with two other actors that are an industrial meat company - use case provider and integration evaluation - and ENS Rennes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 virtual prototyping and biomechanical evaluation.</p><p>The main mission of the recruited post doctoral fellow will be to qualify in biomechanical and ergonomics terms the impact of the successive exoskeleton prototypes on the task (cutting and deboning) realization. This will be done thanks to experimentation in simulated conditions of meat cutting tasks and a motion analysis based on motion capture, EMG and musculoskeletal analysis of the aforementioned tasks.</p><p>\u00a0This research topic will be carried out in Rennes, the capital of Brittany and the tenth largest city in France, with a metropolitan area of about 720,000 inhabitants. Moreover, with more than 66,000 students, Rennes is also the eighth-largest university campus of France and it has the 2nd highest concentration of digital and ICT firms in France after Paris. Rennes is also known to be one of the most festive and lively cities of France, home of several music and culture festivals. In 2018, the newspaper \u00e2\u0080\u009cL'Express\u00e2\u0080\u009d named Rennes as \"the most liveable city in France\".</p><p>The post-doctoral fellow will join the Inria MimeTIC team (https://team.inria.fr/mimetic/), internationally recognized for its multidisciplinary approach to analyse, model and synthesize motion. The candidate will be integrated into a group of about 10 persons working on musculoskeletal simulation and particularly on the CusToM library. The candidate will also have access to unique experimental platforms Immersia and Immermove which offer a high-tech set-up to perform user experiments in real and virtual environments and measure motion (motion capture, EMG, EKG, force sensors, eye trackers).</p><h4>Assignment</h4><p>A post-doctoral fellow will be hired to work full time on the project (12 months) to work at ENS Rennes. His/Her main mission will be the musculoskeletal analysis of the the tasks performed with and without exoskeleton for comparison in biomechanical and ergonomics terms.</p><h4>Main activities</h4><p>He/She will be in charge of two main actions:</p><ul><li>Defining and conducting recurrent experimentations involving meat industry employees, in which meat cutting and deboning tasks will be realized with and without the assistive device</li><li>Defining and conducting a comparative analysis of the impact of the assistive device on the task realization, in biomechanical and ergonomics terms. We particularly focus on approaches such as the maximum acceptable effort to characterize the task in ergonomics terms.</li></ul><p>The post-doctoral fellow will have to manage his/her work within the frame of the projet by retroplanning, team meetings, work presentations and publications.</p><p>Muller, A., Pontonnier, C., Puchaud, P., &amp; Dumont, G.
