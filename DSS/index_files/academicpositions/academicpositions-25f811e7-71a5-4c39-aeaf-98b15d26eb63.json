Our faculty is an inspiring and lively place where enthusiastic and inquisitive staff attempt to find answers to the important legal issues of today. Researchers are able to flourish in the faculty\u2019s vibrant academic community. They develop their own research projects, within the contours set by the faculty\u2019s research programme (<a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/research-programme-faculty-law\">Research programme at the Faculty of Law - About UM - Maastricht University</a>).</p>\n<p>Research is focused on the study of the role of law in an increasingly globalised society. Research involves studying both institutional and substantive developments in the process of Europeanisation and globalisation and the role of the national legal order therein. This takes place by means of comparative research in the main fields of the law and research in the fields of European law, international economic law, human rights and law &amp; technology in a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary context. To this end, various research methods are applied whereby more traditional methods are combined with empirical research methods.</p>\n<p>The Faculty of Law has six departments (Private Law, Public Law, International and European Law, Criminal Law, Tax Law and Foundation and Methods of Law) and hosts twelve research institutes and groups (<a href=\"https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-research-institutes\">Law research institutes - About UM - Maastricht University</a>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "<div class=\"_Section_Section_26Kh4ZAK\">\n<h2 class=\"_Section_title_2lZ2dR7H\">\n<span>Additional information</span>\n</h2>\n<div class=\"_Section_body_1yeeKPXy\">\n<p><strong>Appointment date</strong></p>\n<p>1 September 2022 (preferably).</p>\n<p><strong>Application</strong></p>\n<p>An application consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a fully elaborated proposal drafted in English or Dutch (according to the language in which the dissertation will be written), using the application form attached which\u00a0can be found\u00a0<a href=\"https://cms.academictransfer.com/documents/97/Application_form_PhD_Round_Faculty_of_Law_2022.docx\">here</a>;</li>\n<li>a detailed CV, including \u2013 if applicable \u2013 relevant publications;</li>\n<li>academic transcript of bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees and list of grades;</li>\n<li>a motivation letter;</li>\n<li>a letter of commitment by the envisaged promotor(s),</li>\n<li>the Master\u2019s thesis or, if applicable, another substantial piece of English or Dutch writing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The deadline for submitting your application is up to and including <strong>2 May 2022.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Conditions for submitting an application</strong></p>\n<p>When submitting a proposal the following conditions apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>each candidate will contact, preferably in an early stage, a professor or associate professor of the Faculty of Law who will act as the promotor of the proposed PhD research; he or she will formally endorse his or her commitment as a supervisor to the proposed research by means of a formal letter and will ensure that at least one co-promotor from inside or outside our Faculty will join the team of supervisors;</li>\n<li>each professor or associate professor of the Faculty of Law may commit to only one application either as promotor or co-promotor;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications should be addressed to: <a href=\"mailto:pzfdrvacatures@maastrichtuniversity.nl\">pzfdrvacatures@maastrichtuniversity.nl</a>.
