The candidate will generate cell line models to test individual genetic variants experimentally and will apply deep mutational scanning using variant libraries. You will work in Giulio Superti-Furga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group (CeMM, Vienna) as part of the RE<i>solution</i> consortium, a sister project of <a href=\"https://re-solute.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">RESOLUTE</a>. RE<i>solution</i> is formed by two pharmaceutical companies, one biotech and six academic research institutions. You will interact closely with consortium partners for the functional characterization of selected genetic variants and will have direct assistance from data scientists at CeMM. This position offers a great opportunity to boost the biomedical impact of human transporter research, as it combines state-of-the-art experimental methods and machine learning-driven computational approaches.</p><h2><strong>Requirements and desired qualifications\u00a0</strong></h2><ul><li>PhD in cell biology, biochemistry, genetics or similar</li><li>Experience in site-directed mutagenesis, variant libraries screen or mutational scanning approaches</li><li>Experience in mammalian cell culture, viral delivery systems and flow cytometry</li><li>Sequence analysis using basic bioinformatics tools</li><li>Experience with CRISPR/Cas9 technologies and with encoded biosensors is desirable</li><li>Experience with biochemical/pharmacological analysis of transporters or membrane proteins is a plus</li><li>Inclination to work in a team is important and a proactive attitude required</li><li>Excellent written / oral communication skills in English</li></ul><h2><strong>The RE</strong><i><strong>solution</strong></i><strong> Consortium</strong></h2><p>Starting on June 1st of 2021, the RE<i>solution</i> consortium is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI, www.imi.europa.eu) and consists of 9 partners from academia and the pharmaceutical industry. The consortium is coordinated by the Superti-Furga laboratory and builds on the successful work of the RESOLUTE consortium, which focuses on the systematic de-orphanization of SLCs and is creating open-access tools, high-throughput assays and omics data. While RESOLUTE is focused on basic aspects of SLC biochemistry and biology, RE<i>solution</i> adds a medical genomics dimension. RE<i>solution</i> assembles human SLC genetic information, annotates the data within the RESOLUTE knowledgebase, studies the structure-activity relationship for selected SLC variants, and uses deep mutagenesis and artificial intelligence to develop better models for the interpretation of SLC genetic variation. Contextualization of SLCs in the human medical genetics landscape is an important step towards the establishment of the medically relevant but understudied SLC family as a tractable target class. \u00a0</p><h2><strong>The Superti-Furga Laboratory\u00a0</strong></h2><p>The Superti-Furga group (<a href=\"http://superti-furga-lab.at/\" target=\"_blank\">http://superti-furga-lab.at/</a><u>)</u> is composed of an international and highly productive team of more than 30 scientists. As a leader in the field, the laboratory investigates how cells and biological systems in general manage access to the environment through cellular transport. In particular how access to nutrients and energy source is tuned to metabolism and need of individual cell types. Moreover, the lab has pioneered approaches for functional precision medicine. The laboratory operates on a truly multidisciplinary basis and involves functional genomics and proteomics, structural analysis, chemical biology, high-content imaging, bioinformatics and physiology, reflecting the blend of expertise of the laboratory members (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2282-0\" target=\"_blank\">Heinz et al, Nature. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0483-3\" target=\"_blank\">Girardi et al, Nat Chem Biol. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19871-x\" target=\"_blank\">Girardi et al, Nat Commun. 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00386-8\" target=\"_blank\">Li et al, Nat Metab. 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27329-x\" target=\"_blank\">Pemovska et al, Nat Commun. 2021</a>).</p><h2><strong>About the Institute</strong></h2><p>CeMM is one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading biomedical research institutes. CeMM researchers routinely publish important discoveries in top journals. Over the last seven years, this included &gt;10 papers in Nature/Cell/Science/NEJM and &gt;30 papers in Nature/Cell sister journals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a team of 120-150 scientists. Research at CeMM is exceptionally collaborative and has strong focus on medical impact, based on a profound molecular understanding of diseases such as cancer and immune disorders. CeMM is part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a founding member of EU-LIFE. It is located at the center of one of the largest medical campuses in Europe, within walking distance of Vienna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical city center. A study by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d put CeMM among the top-5 best places to work in academia worldwide (<a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676</a>).
