The role will primarily involve the operation of a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) and 3D OrbiSIMS instrument [Passarelli et al. Nature Methods 2017]. Working closely with Dr. David Scurr and Prof. Morgan Alexander, the role is an opportunity to undertake research employing state-of-the-art secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and data analytics. The University of Nottingham is the first of only two academic institutions worldwide to possess a 3D OrbiSIMS instrument.&nbsp;The aim of the post is to facilitate SIMS instrument access, operations and training for users (typically PhD students and post-doctoral researchers), consulting on aspects covering experimental design, data acquisition / analysis and reporting. These interactions generate multidisciplinary collaborative high impact research opportunities within the School of Pharmacy as well as within other schools including Physics, Life Sciences, Medicine and Chemistry. As well as supporting research at the University of Nottingham, the role holder will have the opportunity to develop their own areas of independent research and build national and international collaborative research projects and networks. &nbsp;Candidates should have, or be close to completion of, a PhD in a discipline relevant to mass spectrometry. Experience of mass spectrometry and associated data analysis is essential. Experience of ToF-SIMS, 3D OrbiSIMS, or Orbital trapping mass spectrometry would be beneficial. The candidate will be required to support research activities through the day-to-day management of the Nottingham SIMS Facility. Candidates must have excellent communication skills, an aptitude for critical thinking and a flexible approach to collaborative research.This full-time post (36.25 hours per week) will be offered on a fixed-term contract for 36 months. Job share arrangements may be considered.Informal enquiries can be addressed to Dr. David Scurr (david.scurr@nottingham.ac.uk) and / or Prof. Morgan Alexander (morgan.alexander@nottingham.ac.uk).
