The scheme is part of a talent management policy shared with partner institutions, particularly research organizations. Synergies with the systems of these organizations, whether ATIP-Avenir or \"Inria Starting Faculty Position\", will be sought.DurationThe chair will be funded for a period between three and five years maximum. The chairholder will be first recruited on a fixed-term contract as a lecturer-researcher during which his or her work is monitored and evaluated (evaluation at 3 years and then at the end of the chair). If the evaluations are successful, the University of Bordeaux will then publish a statutory position. This recruitment will be carried out via the traditional competitive procedure.FundingThe funding will cover the salary of the project leader for a maximum of 5 years (3-year fixed-term contract renewable for 2 years after evaluation; or 3 years + 1 year, 2 years + 2 years; 2 years + 1 year depending on the situation). In addition, as this is an attractiveness scheme targeting the teaching and research profession, a teaching service with a minimum of 64 hours/year may be requested.Project-related costs such as running costs, equipment and for the recruitment of staff dedicated to the project, may complete the Chair's budget. This can be done either within the framework of this program or within the framework of external funding (regional chair, Atip Avenir), depending on the recruitment situation.The main stages of this scheme are explained below:For further information on the call for applications, the eligibility criteria and the evaluation process, please refer to the Applicant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide (additional documents section).Disciplinary field(s): Physics&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeted CNU4 section(s):28th section \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Dense Media and Materials30th section - Diluted Media and Optics&nbsp;&nbsp;RESEARCH PROFILE&nbsp;&nbsp;Research profile title:&nbsp;Photonics&nbsp;Research department5:&nbsp;Material and light sciences&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Profile:&nbsp;Laboratory(ies):Center of Intense Lasers and Applications (CELIA)&nbsp;Wave and Material Laboratory of Aquitaine (LOMA)&nbsp;Photonics, numerical and Nanosciences Laboratory (LP2N)&nbsp;&nbsp;Director(s) of Laboratory(ies) - contacts details:&nbsp;CELIA : Eric Mevel /&nbsp;eric.mevel@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;LOMA : Fabio Pistolesi /&nbsp;fabio.pistolesi@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;LP2N : Laurent Cognet /&nbsp;laurent.Cognet@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the research project&nbsp;The hired person must have demonstrated high level expertise in photonics and light matter interaction, either on experimental or theoretical aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected competences:&nbsp;\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The research project must be compatible with one of the main research area of the three&nbsp;above mentioned research units, involved in the Light Research Program, such as:&nbsp;Ultrafast phenomena in liquids and solids,Laser induced structuration of materials for photonics,Laser plasmas interactions in extreme conditions,Particle acceleration by laser,Plasmonics,Nanostructure spectroscopy at individual and mesoscopic scales,Resonant photonic systems,Non linear optics,Singular optics,Optical and thermal microscopies,THz spectroscopy,Quantum systems,Opto-mechanics,Innovative imaging,Biophotonics,Photonics of complex systems,Modelisation and simulation on the above topics.&nbsp;Expected scientific impact:&nbsp;The three research units CELIA, LOMA and LP2N are strongly involved in the Light Research Program and particularly within the four themes of the project :&nbsp;Extreme states of matter and light,Hybrid systems for quantum technologies,Compact optical systems,Hybridization in biophotonics and imaging.&nbsp;EDUCATION PROFILE&nbsp;&nbsp;Title of the training profile:&nbsp;Physics&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment component6:&nbsp;College of Science and Technology&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical profile: Physics of lasers and photonics&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical assignment (education unit):&nbsp;Physics department&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of the education unit - contact details:&nbsp;Pr Christophe CHAMPION \u00e2\u0080\u0093&nbsp;christophe.champion@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;&nbsp;Training courses concerned:&nbsp;The recruited candidate will be required to teach Physics at the following levels :- Master of Fundamental Physics and Applications (M1+M2): lasers, photonics, radiation-matter interaction ;&nbsp;- EUR Light (M1+M2) : plasmas, non-linear optics ;&nbsp;- Pro Bachelor \u00c2\u00ab Lasers, Contr\u00c3\u00b4le et Maintenance \u00c2\u00bb : laser physics, instrumentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical objectives and need for supervision:&nbsp;The recruited candidate will also :&nbsp;- contribute to the evolution of teaching practices within the Physics Training Unit as part of the continuous improvement of the Physics Masters.&nbsp;In line with the roadmap of the Mention Master, he.she will have to :&nbsp;- participate in the reflection group on the continuous improvement of the training offer in the framework of accreditation 2022-2027 ;&nbsp;- work on the opening of Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courses in internationalization and the socio-economic world (internships and Bachelor/Master projects) ;&nbsp;- identify the axes to be developed in order to promote interdisciplinarity between Mentions de Bachelor and/or Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s course.4 Website of the national council of universities (CNU) : https://conseil-national-des-universites.fr/cnu/#/5 Description of the research departments : https://www.u-bordeaux.com/Research/Research-departments6 Description of the training structures: https://www.u-bordeaux.com/Education/Colleges-Institutes", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "Our values are based on an open and humanistic philosophy, favoring the principles of freedom, creativity and responsibility in education and research.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDEzXC8wNFwvYm9yZGVhdXgtbG9nby5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6W119"}
