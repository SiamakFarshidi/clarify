The meaning of language. A digital grammar of the Greek taught at schools in Late Constantinople&nbsp;(https://research.flw.ugent.be/nl/projects/mela-meaning-language-digital-grammar-greek-taught-schools-late-constantinople). Prof. Dr. Andrea Cuomo, with his interest in the history of Medieval Greek and the reception of classical literature in Byzantium, is the principal investigator.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR TASKS&nbsp;Area of research of MELA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MELA primarily aims to create the first digital grammar of the Greek taught at schools in late Byzantium on the basis of textbooks for the teaching of Greek and their manuscript copies composed by (or within the networks of pupils, scribes, etc. of) scholars ranging from Planoudes (\u00e2\u0080\u00a01305) to Gregoras (\u00e2\u0080\u00a0c. 1360). Overall, textbooks considered by MELA may be divided into the following categories: (1) works defined by author and genre (e.g. Planoudes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Dialogue on Grammar); (2) lemmata on grammar that flowed into dictionaries (e.g. Moschopoulos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Collection of Attic Words), provided with stylistic examples from model authors; 2a Comments on model authors; (3) scholars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notes on grammatical topics; 3a anonymous treatises, sketches, reworked excerpts of larger works.&nbsp;Area of research of your dissertationYou will write a doctoral dissertation on the philological accuracy of the Greek text of the sources that constitute MELA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital grammar.MELA is an open-access searchable textual corpus database, created on the basis of textbooks for the teaching of Greek.
