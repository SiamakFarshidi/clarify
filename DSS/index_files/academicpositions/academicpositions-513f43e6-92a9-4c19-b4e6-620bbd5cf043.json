The project aims to improve existing harvesting methods and establish new cultivation methods of the red seaweed species, Palmaria palmata (also called dulse), based on geographical specificity of each partner country.The project is based on the \u00e2\u0080\u009clocal phenotypic identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d of dulse, which can be related to geographical as well as physical differences (e.g. seawater temperature, salinity and daylength). In the project, common features and aspects will be used towards a common solution for both improved harvesting of wild dulse as well as new cultivation techniques. The purpose of the project is to uncover good practice for cultivating and harvesting the red algae \u00e2\u0080\u009cdulse\u00e2\u0080\u009d along the North Atlantic coastline.
