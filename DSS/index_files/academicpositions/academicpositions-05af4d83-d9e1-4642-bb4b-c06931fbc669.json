The combination of our widely acclaimed leadership in microchip technology and profound software and ICT expertise is what makes us unique. By leveraging our world-class infrastructure and local and global ecosystem of partners across a multitude of industries, we create groundbreaking innovation in application domains such as healthcare, smart cities and mobility, logistics and manufacturing, and energy. &nbsp;As a trusted partner for companies, start-ups and universities we bring together close to 3,500 brilliant minds from over 70 nationalities. Imec is headquartered in Leuven, Belgium and also has distributed R&amp;D groups at a number of Flemish universities, in the Netherlands, Taiwan, USA, China, and offices in India and Japan. All of these particular traits make imec to be a top-class employer.&nbsp;University of Antwerp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 imec IDLab Research groupThe Internet &amp; Data Lab (IDLab) is an imec research group at the University of Antwerp and Ghent University. IDLab&nbsp;focuses its research on&nbsp;internet technologies&nbsp;and&nbsp;data science. IDLab is a joint research initiative between Ghent University and the University of Antwerp. Bringing together 300 internet experts, we develop technologies outperforming current solutions for communication subsystems, high speed and low power networking, distributed computing and multimedia processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence and web semantics. Within Antwerp, the overall IDLab&nbsp;research areas&nbsp;are machine learning and wireless networking. &nbsp;IDLab has a unique&nbsp;research infrastructure&nbsp;used in numerous national and international collaborations.&nbsp; &nbsp;IDLab collaborates with many universities and research centres worldwide and jointly develops&nbsp;advanced technologies with industry&nbsp;(R&amp;D centers from international companies, Flanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 top innovating large companies and SME\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, as well as numerous ambitious startups).For further development&nbsp;of the IDLab AI Applications program, we are looking for an AI project manager who facilitates and leads research projects in close collaboration with industry.The AI Applications team aims to bring state-of-the-art machine learning methods to industry, bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications. The team performs applied and fundamental research in areas such as data-driven modeling, deep learning and reinforcement learning to tackle real world challenges in industry. Our goal is to make AI safely and reliably applicable in an industrial context, where it should complement, enhance, or replace the state of the art in complex control scenarios where current techniques fail to deliver. The team applies its AI solutions in domains such as chemical engineering, autonomous shipping, beyond-5G wireless communication, mobility, and logistics, in collaboration with key industry partners in their respective domains.The jobFor our AI research in mobility and logistics we are looking for a manager to lead ongoing research projects, drive consortium building and develop new research proposals. You will participate in international (e.g., Horizon Europe) and national projects (e.g., imec ICON, bilateral projects), where the aim is to develop novel AI-driven optimization methods. Together with a team of PhD students and data scientists, you will tackle challenges such as optimizing supply chain logistics in retail, predicting ETAs in multimodal transport, and developing novel AI-driven solutions for the smart port of the future. With your team you will take a deep dive in techniques such as data-driven modelling, large-scale simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle these industrial challenges head on. You participate in research projects in the framework of European and national research projects, in close collaboration with industry. You follow up on progress within research projects and are able to communicate the accomplished/in-process work to internal and external stakeholders and adapt where needed. You lead a technical team going forward in implementing research projects. You interface and collaborate on a technical level with research partners from industry and academia. You develop project proposals for the Horizon Europe Program and national projects, both in fundamental and collaborative programs. You can also be involved in the technical project execution, if interested, in parallel to the project management. Job requirements You have a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics or equivalent and have experience in managing AI (research) projects, or a PhD in one of these fields. You have affinity with academic research, but also want to make a difference in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial and societal challenges. You can translate the business requirements of partners to technical challenges, and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 together with researchers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 define clear methodologies for addressing them. You have a general background in AI and hands-on experience with machine learning projects. Prior experience with reinforcement learning and graph neural networks is a plus. Knowledge of logistics and/or mobility is an advantage, particularly in the context of AI-driven optimization. You have experience with managing and supervising team members. You consider yourself a machine learning expert. You can explain the challenges of machine learning to a broad non-technical audience, but also have an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects Having experience with participating / leading in national and/or international research projects is an advantage. Having experience in proposal writing in national and / or international research projects is an advantage You are a team player and have strong communication skills.
