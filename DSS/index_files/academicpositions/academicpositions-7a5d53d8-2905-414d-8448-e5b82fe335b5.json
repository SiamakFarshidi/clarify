Insurers collect fine-grained, high-dimensional data, where both the presence of covariates of different types (e.g., continuous, factor, spatial) as well as the volume of the data are challenging.&nbsp; At the same time, the response variables that matter in insurance are characterized by low frequency occurrences, severities or impacts that range from small to (very) large, presence of dependence among losses and incomplete losses due to censoring and truncation. Clearly, these challenges require sound methodological contributions in statistical modelling to avoid bias, loss of information and wrongly selected variables or models.In response to these challenges, the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (ISBA) of the UCLouvain and &nbsp;the KU Leuven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Faculty of Economics and Business open vacancies fora.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 PhD position at UCLouvain.
