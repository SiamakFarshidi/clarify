AHM&rsquo;s research agenda is streamed into five Research Themes that cross and connect the fields of heritage, memory studies and material culture.: <em>Museums &amp; Memorials</em>, <em>Heritage &amp; Conflict</em>, <em>Transnational Memory Narrative</em>s, <em>Digitality &amp; E-Memories, Materiality &amp; Material Culture</em>.
