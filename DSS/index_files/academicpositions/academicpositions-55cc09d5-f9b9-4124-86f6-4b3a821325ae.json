You will be instrumental in helping shape our future approaches and developing our relationships with industry. Make an impact through harnessing the opportunities created by our new \u00c2\u00a370m Institute of Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems (IAAPS), along with government and automotive industry investment.&nbsp; Your work on electric propulsion is expected to contribute significantly to the University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s climate targets and commitments.About the role:You will participate in high-impact research programmes, provide excellent postgraduate research supervision, and deliver high-quality teaching. Making a major contribution to developing our portfolio of high-quality collaborative research in the electrified propulsion field.One of our key areas of activity has always been the development of new experimental and simulation techniques and these areas come together as the industry moves towards a more digital product development process. It will be important for you to contribute to the development of new approaches, combining advanced simulation techniques with novel experimental approaches to design a faster, better product development toolchain.&nbsp; More information about this opportunity and associated vacancies can be found here.About you:You will have an established or developing track record in electrified propulsion of passenger cars, with a particular focus on system-level considerations. Broader experience of the wider automotive propulsion landscape will be advantageous. You will ideally have expertise in Model Based Systems Engineering approaches leading to formal consideration of system level aspects of design, optimisation and validation.You will be committed to developing you teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate level, from fundamental electronic and electrical engineering material to advanced modules at Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level, such as electric vehicle design. A willingness to participate in the Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s student design and research projects is also expected. Preference will be given to applicants with a background in the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques within their area of electrified automotive propulsion systems.About us:The Department of Electronical and Electrical Engineering holds a Bronze Award for the Athena SWAN scheme, which promotes gender equality among all disciplines. We particularly encourage applications from under-represented groups.This new position will form part of the new \u00c2\u00a370m Institute of Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems (IAAPS) which is currently under construction and is intended to be one of the top three sites in the world for advanced propulsion systems research. It builds on 40 years of continuous propulsion research and education at the University including the new EPSRC Centre of Doctoral Training (CDT), which over the next five years will provide at least 86 fully funded studentships for a four-year combined training and research programme leading to an MPhil and PhD.The current automotive propulsion research academic team has an excellent track record in delivering industry-relevant projects and has long-established collaborations with industrial partners. These new appointments are expected to benefit from, and contribute to, this strong industry partnership and will also have the freedom to explore fundamental research interests.This is an exciting opportunity to join an expanding research group that is receiving substantial investment from Government, the Automotive Industries and the University.For more information:&nbsp;Informal enquiries about the post may be made to either:Professor Adrian Evans, Head, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Tel: +44 (0)1225 386303 Email: a.n.evans@bath.ac.uk&nbsp;orProfessor Furong Li, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Tel: +44 (0)1225 386416 Email: f.li@bath.ac.uk&nbsp;Closing date: Monday 2 May 2022.Interview date: Tuesday 31 May 2022.To apply please click hereFind out from our staff what makes the University of Bath a great place to work.
