Are you passionate about (project-based) teaching and eager to apply transdisciplinary education to its fullest potential?</p><p>Digitisation poses new questions and challenges for our societies, but it also brings new opportunities to intervene in societal issues such as inequality and climate change.&nbsp; Our unique undergraduate programme in Computational Social Science focuses on digital interventions for complex societal problems and will welcome its first students in September 2022. Preparations are in full swing and therefore, we are looking for lecturers to join our team to make an active contribution to course design and course development. In addition, the lecturers will fulfil the role of Senior Tutor for our students during the course of their projects and degree programme.</p><p>The undergraduate programme Computational Social Science is a joint initiative of three faculties of the University of Amsterdam. Scientifically grounded in social sciences, informatics and humanities expertise, Computational Social Science students develop skills to design, create, apply and appropriate digital technology and data science to benefit society. All teaching activities are centred around projects within intensive, semester-length courses of 30 ECTS and require active involvement from each student.</p><p><strong>What are you going to do</strong></p><p>As a Lecturer/Senior Tutor, you will take the lead in developing innovative teaching materials and activities within our transdisciplinary, project based curriculum.
