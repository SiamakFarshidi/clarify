Engaged in the fields of energy and the environment for several years, the university participates in the development of new technologies and in a global and multidisciplinary approach essential to understanding, anticipating and supporting energy transformation processes.\u00a0</p><p>In the current context of climate emergency and energy transition, the UPPA is focusing its research efforts on deepening knowledge in many areas in order to provide the best solutions. For example, research on ecosystem functioning, resource management and the use of low-carbon energy sources are all priority areas of study. To this end, research at UPPA on these themes is carried out in the disciplines of<strong> Science and Technology\u00a0</strong>(mathematics, geosciences, ecology, oceanography, engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics, etc.) as well as in <strong>Social Sciences and the Humanities\u00a0</strong>(social sciences, economics, law, geography\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). The theme of energy and environmental transition is therefore a source of innovation for the University and it enjoys high visibility and real interdisciplinarity through its research laboratories and the E2S UPPA project.\u00a0</p><p>Integrating the <strong>EDENE doctoral programme\u00a0</strong>within the UPPA thus means becoming an actor of this change by being a creative force on innovative research topics. It is a unique opportunity to develop interdisciplinary and to carry out applied research on the impacts of climate change and on new methods of reducing the massive use of fossil fuels with the aim of increasing the use of low-carbon energy sources for an efficient energy transition and thus contribute to the implementation of a more sustainable environment.\u00a0</p><p>*UPPA Universit\u00c3\u00a9 de Pau et des Pays de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Adour\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.univ-pau.fr/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.univ-pau.fr/en/home.html</a></p>\n</div>", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "N/A", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyM2ZcL2JmNlwvMjNmYmY2M2EyNmFlMjFlNzVmYmQyMjZlMzQ4M2RlZjAucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
