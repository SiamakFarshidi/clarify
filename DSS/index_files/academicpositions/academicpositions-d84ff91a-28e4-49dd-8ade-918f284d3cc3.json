The University of Lausanne is a higher teaching and research institution composed of seven faculties where approximately 15,500 students and nearly 5000 collaborators, professors, and researchers work and study.Job informationExpected start date in position: 1.4.2022 or to be agreedContract length: 1 year, possibility to be renewed, maximum 3 years Activity rate: 100%Workplace: Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, LausanneYour responsibilitiesInsulin secretion from pancreatic \u00ce\u00b2 -cells plays a central role in the control of body metabolism. Dysfunction and/or loss of \u00ce\u00b2-cells can result in the release of insufficient insulin and in the development of different forms of diabetes mellitus. Recent studies from different laboratories including ours provided evidence that non-coding RNAs play an important role in the control of \u00ce\u00b2-cell activities. The goal of the project will be to determine the involvement of microRNAs and other newly discovered classes of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of \u00ce\u00b2-cell functions and to evaluate their contribution in the appearance of diabetes mellitus.Your qualificationsThe position requires a doctoral degree in Life Sciences or related disciplines. The candidate should be highly motivated, self-driven, be able to work well in a team as well as independently. Candidates with experience in molecular biology, gene expression analysis and animal experimentation will be preferred.
