The BSF is Austria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first and leading center of expertise for next-generation sequencing in biomedicine. Led by Christoph Bock (https://bocklab.org) and with a dedicated team of staff scientists, the BSF contributes to biomedical research and whole genome medicine in Vienna, Austria, and internationally. The BSF is equipped with the latest technology for high-throughput genomics (Illumina NovaSeq, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics, etc.) and powerful scientific computing infrastructure. The BSF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandate includes a strong focus on technology development, contribution to study design and bioinformatic data analysis, as well as training and teaching best practices in sequencing technology and genomic medicine. Furthermore, it supports biomedical scientists and clinicians in the development of custom NGS protocols and in the bioinformatic analysis of the resulting datasets.The Institute (http://www.cemm.at)CeMM is one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading biomedical research institutes. CeMM researchers routinely publish important discoveries in top journals. Over the last seven years, this included &gt;10 papers in Nature/Cell/Science/NEJM and &gt;30 papers in Nature/Cell sister journals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a team of 120-150 scientists. Research at CeMM is exceptionally collaborative and has strong focus on medical impact, based on a profound molecular understanding of diseases such as cancer and immune disorders. CeMM is part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a founding member of EU-LIFE. It is located at the center of one of the largest medical campuses in Europe, within walking distance of Vienna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical city center. A study by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Scientist\u00e2\u0080\u009d put CeMM among the top-5 best places to work in academia worldwide (https://www.the-scientist.com/features/best-places-to-work-academia-2012-40676). Vienna is frequently ranked the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best city to live. It is a United Nations city with a large English-speaking community. The official language at CeMM is English, and &gt;49 different nationalities are represented at the institute.
