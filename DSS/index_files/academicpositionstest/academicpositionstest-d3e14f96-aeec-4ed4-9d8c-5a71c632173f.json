The scheme is part of a talent management policy shared with partner institutions, particularly research organizations. Synergies with the systems of these organizations, whether ATIP-Avenir or \"Inria Starting Faculty Position\", will be sought.DurationThe chair will be funded for a period between three and five years maximum. The chairholder will be first recruited on a fixed-term contract as a lecturer-researcher during which his or her work is monitored and evaluated (evaluation at 3 years and then at the end of the chair). If the evaluations are successful, the University of Bordeaux will then publish a statutory position. This recruitment will be carried out via the traditional competitive procedure.FundingThe funding will cover the salary of the project leader for a maximum of 5 years (3-year fixed-term contract renewable for 2 years after evaluation; or 3 years + 1 year, 2 years + 2 years; 2 years + 1 year depending on the situation). In addition, as this is an attractiveness scheme targeting the teaching and research profession, a teaching service with a minimum of 64 hours/year may be requested.Project-related costs such as running costs, equipment and for the recruitment of staff dedicated to the project, may complete the Chair's budget. This can be done either within the framework of this program or within the framework of external funding (regional chair, Atip Avenir), depending on the recruitment situation.The main stages of this scheme are explained below:For further information on the call for applications, the eligibility criteria and the evaluation process, please refer to the Applicant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide (additional documents section).Disciplinary field(s): Biological sciences, agricultural sciences&nbsp;Targeted CNU4 section(s): 66th section - PhysiologyRESEARCH PROFILE&nbsp;Research profile title: Plant (eco)physiology: plant-environment interactionsResearch department5:&nbsp;Environmental sciences&nbsp;&nbsp;Research Profile:&nbsp;&nbsp;Laboratory(ies):&nbsp;Ecophysiology and Grape Functional Genomics (EGFV)&nbsp;Fruit Biology and Pathology (BFP)&nbsp;Laboratory of Membrane Biogenesis (LBM)&nbsp;&nbsp;Director(s) of Laboratory(ies) - contacts details:&nbsp;EGFV : Nathalie Ollat /&nbsp;nathalie.ollat@inrae.frBFP : Yves Gibon /&nbsp;yves.gibon@inrae.fr&nbsp;&nbsp;LBM : S\u00c3\u00a9bastien Mongrand /&nbsp;s\u00c3\u00a9bastien.mongrand@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the research project:&nbsp;- UMR1287 EGFV which conducts integrative biology studies to analyze and simulate physiological interactions between the grafted vine and its environment, by targeting more particularly the effects of abiotic constraints on the compromises between biomass allocation and the metabolism of grape berries; the \"Flowering, Fruit Development and Environmental Constraints&nbsp;&nbsp;- FDFE\" team of UMR1332 BFP which studies the developmental biology of fleshy fruits by dissecting in particular the genetic, physiological and molecular mechanisms involved during the establishment of reproductive organs, particularly in response environmental constraints;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the UMR5200 LBM which studies physiologically, metabolically and developmentally the effects of environmental stress on plant lipid metabolism.&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry out his.her work, the successful candidate will be able to rely on skills in physiology, analytical biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, modeling and phenotyping present within the units of the department, as well as on the experimental infrastructures. of the INRAE green campus in Villenave d'Ornon. More broadly, he.she will have access to the platforms present on the site, in particular the Plant Imaging Center (Bordeaux Imaging Center) and the Metabolome (metabolome / lipidome / fluxome) platform in Bordeaux.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected competences:&nbsp;The candidate must have recognized experience in the field of ecophysiology and/ or physiology of plant/environment interactions. He.she will be responsible for carrying out research to improve knowledge of the (eco)physiological and/or cellular mechanisms implemented by plants in response to various stresses, and their impact on growth/yield/composition balances. The recruited person must be involved in supervising doctoral students, and have a strong ability to work in a team. He.she should be able to develop collaborations at national and international level on his.her theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected scientific impact:&nbsp;The project developed by the successful candidate will contribute to strengthening the thematic axis \"Plant sciences and their products\" led by the Department of Environmental Sciences. The candidate's research project could in particular be developed through the major research program \"Bordeaux Plant Science\" of the University of Bordeaux. He.she will participate in the international influence of the University in the field of plant sciences, through research and training through research.&nbsp;&nbsp;EDUCATION PROFILE&nbsp;Title of the training profile:&nbsp;Plant biology, ecophysiology and plant physiology&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment component6:&nbsp;College of Science and Technology&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical profile:&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical assignment (education unit):&nbsp;Biology&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of the education unit - contact details:&nbsp;\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric G\u00c3\u00a9vaudant / frederic.gevaudant@u-bordeaux.fr&nbsp;&nbsp;Training courses concerned:&nbsp;Bachelor's and Master's degrees&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedagogical objectives and need for supervision:&nbsp;\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The assistant professor recruited will join the UF of Biology and will mainly teach plant ecophysiology, plant biology, and plant physiology in the first to third year of the Life Sciences Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree and in the Master's degree in Biology and Agrosciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the concepts of unity and diversity of living organisms will be approached by taking the plant world as an example from the first year in the Life Sciences License. It will address the notion of plant/environment interaction, and in particular the responses to biotic and abiotic factors. For the latter, the assistant professor recruited will have to bring a vision of these responses at different scales, from the whole plant to the cellular scale through the organ scale (biomass reallocation, impact on growth, metabolic adaptations, etc..), and of the consequences on the growth and the development of the plant, as well as of the modeling approaches allowing to address them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Master in Biology and Agrosciences has a strong international component through several double degrees and a joint degree, the lecturer recruited will have to teach part of his or her courses in English.&nbsp;Finally, the candidate recruited will be required to participate in the organization and running of international summer schools associated with the Bachelor's and Master's degrees and to take responsibility for teaching units.&nbsp;The assistant professor recruited will also be able to participate (depending on his/her expertise) in the teaching of agro-ecology and agrosystem management, notably by approaching the notions of compromise between maintaining production and tolerance of stresses by limiting the impacts on the environment (reduction of inputs/phyto-stimulations). The teaching of modeling approaches in agronomy and ecophysiology can also be taught.4 Website of the national council of universities (CNU) : https://conseil-national-des-universites.fr/cnu/#/5 Description of the research departments : https://www.u-bordeaux.com/Research/Research-departments6 Description of the training structures: https://www.u-bordeaux.com/Education/Colleges-Institutes&nbsp;", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "Our values are based on an open and humanistic philosophy, favoring the principles of freedom, creativity and responsibility in education and research.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDEzXC8wNFwvYm9yZGVhdXgtbG9nby5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6W119"}
