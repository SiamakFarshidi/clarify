More information for the new call-out will come up after Autumn 2022. Stay tuned!&nbsp;Our PhD program in the life sciences places special emphasis on interdisciplinary interactions. We want to train the next generation of scientists to study complex biological processes that cannot be adequately understood within the limits of a single discipline. By combining methods and approaches from different scientific fields, our students aim to address topics inaccessible to isolated research areas.Around 50 young scientists are currently working towards their PhD in our program; just over a third come from Germany, the rest from around the world. Twenty-five eminent group leaders provide project supervision, plus expertise and infrastructure across the following traditionally separate fields:We offer:Cutting-edge research projects and excellent facilitiesFull funding through doctoral fellowshipsStructured support through a personal thesis advisory committeeSupporting curriculum with many optional coursesInternational environment with English as the working languagePersonal assistance with relocationOur program is based in Tuebingen, a hotspot for science and research in southwest Germany.
