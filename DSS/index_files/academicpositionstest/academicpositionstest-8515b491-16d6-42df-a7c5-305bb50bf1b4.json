With over 26,000 students and more than 4000 scientists, research, teaching and learning dedicated to the advancement of science and technology have been conducted here for more than 200 years, guided by the motto \"Technology for People\". As a driver of innovation, TU Wien fosters close collaboration with business and industry and contributes to the prosperity of society.The Faculty of Informatics at TU Wien invites applications for a full time Assistant Professor position (tenure track). The position is directed to Complexity Science for Societal Good and is affiliated with the Institute of Information Systems Engineering, in close collaboration with the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. The estimated starting date is September 1, 2022. The work contract is initially limited to six years. The candidate and TU Wien can agree upon a tenure evaluation, which when positive, opens the possibility to change the position to Associate Professor with an unlimited contract.&nbsp;TU Wien is among the most successful technical universities in Europe and it is Austria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest scientific-technical research and educational institution. The Faculty of Informatics, one of the eight faculties at TU Wien, plays an active role in national and international research and has an excellent reputation. The main areas of research include Computer Engineering, Logic and Computation, Visual Computing &amp; Human-Centered Technology, as well as Information Systems Engineering.Tasks:While companies are often good at using customer data to increase their commercial success, governments and public administrations hardly ever use the data that they collect to its full potential for providing benefits to society. This full potential arises through understanding data not in isolation but taking the complexity of interdependencies and interconnections into account. Such benefits could include using insights obtained from the data to improve public services, or to better understand the impacts on society of changes in legislation or of external factors such as natural disasters. There is a large potential in using open data for this purpose, but the use of non-public data generally opens up more possibilities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 commercial data is now also starting to be used for societal insights. As the data is often analysed for purposes for which it was not originally collected, it is necessary to compensate for potential biases in the results. The candidate will work at the interface of data science and complexity science together with governments and public administrations, and should therefore also pay attention to presenting results in a suitable way for use by decision makers. The Digital Humanism Initiative on ensuring that technology development remains centred on human interests should play a central role in this work (https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/).Candidates should have a background and experience in building data science system prototypes that target a well-defined application area and analyse real-world data.
