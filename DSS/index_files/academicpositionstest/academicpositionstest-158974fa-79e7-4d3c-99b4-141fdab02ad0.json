This study is co-financed by five major industrial groups: Arcelor Mittal, Aperam, Aubert &amp; Duval, Safran and Vallourec.The scientific project of the Chair Liquid Metal concerns a detailed understanding of the thermochemical interactions within the liquid metal pool between its components (inclusions-liquid metal-and possibly slag), with a view to the production of metal alloys with controlled chemical and inclusionary cleanliness.Under the responsibility of the Chairholder, he will carry out the modelling work of the Chair's scientific program over a period of 18 months.The aim of this post-doctorate is to continue the development of an inclusion precipitation-growth model and to integrate it into a more complete ladle refining process model.Missions / ActivitiesThe post-doctoral fellow will carry out the following activities:Couple the thermokinetic model developed within the framework of the Chair with the thermodynamic software Thermo-Calc, in order to model the germination and growth of oxide-type inclusions in liquid steel.Implement previous modelling work on the evolution mechanisms of the inclusionary population on larger scales (aggregation, trapping, etc.).Use this model to study the deoxidation of special steels during ladle refining.Develop the modelling of reaction mechanisms within the framework of a heterogeneous chemical inclusionary population.SkillsThe candidate must have a PhD thesis in modelling in the field of materials and/or metallurgy.He/she must have scientific experience in the study of thermodynamic and thermokinetic phenomena of germination-growth (e.g. in precipitation, solidification, formation of metallic phases..).He/she must master at least one programming language that he/she has used for the development of his/her own models: C++, Fortran, Java, Matlab or, ideally, Python.He/she must have expertise in the use of thermodynamic software based on the Calphad method (e.g. Thermo-Calc, FactSage..) in the context of his/her previous research work.Constraints and risksThe position you are applying for is located in a sector relating to the protection of scientific and technical potential. It therefore requires, in accordance with the regulations, that your arrival be authorized by the competent authority of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.About Institut Jean LamourThe Institut Jean Lamour (IJL) is a joint research unit of CNRS and Universit\u00c3\u00a9 de Lorraine It is linked to the Institute of Chemistry of CNRS.Focused on materials and processes science and engineering, it covers: materials, metallurgy, plasmas, surfaces, nanomaterials and electronics.It regroups 183 researchers/lecturers, 91 engineers/technicians/administrative staff, 150 doctoral students and 25 post-doctoral fellows.Partnerships exist with 150 companies and our research groups collaborate with more than 30 countries throughout the world.Its exceptional instrumental platforms are spread over 4 sites; the main one is located on Artem campus in Nancy.The Elaboration Processes team of IJL has long experience in the engineering of elaboration processes for metallic materials. It is an original \"process\" type approach in the scientific and industrial \"materials\" community. It calls on complementary skills in the fields of thermochemistry, heat-mass transport phenomena, fluid mechanics and numerical simulation techniques. A large part of these studies is carried out in collaboration with industrial users of pyrometallurgical production processes.In 2019, the team hosted the industrial chair Liquid Metal, co-financed by the Metropole du Grand Nancy, the University of Lorraine, the CNRS and five industrial sponsors (Arcelor Mittal, Aperam, Aubert &amp; Duval, Safran, Vallourec). It was created within the framework of the \"Metallurgy\" Scientific Interest Group in order to strengthen France's potential in this field for a period of 5 years until December 2023.ApplicationApplicants are invited to send a r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 and cover letter to:thibault.quatravaux@univ-lorraine.fr", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "Universit\u00c3\u00a9 de Lorraine promotes\u00c2\u00a0innovation through the dialogue of knowledge, taking advantage of the variety and strength of its scientific fields, and aiming at the promotion of knowledge transfer to irrigate innovation and economic growth as well as the progress of fundamental science.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDEzXC8xMlwvbG9ycmFpbmUucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="}
