The hypothalamus is part of the diencephalon that is involved in a variety of functions including the maintenance of the homeostasis, metabolism, stress, the circadian rhythm or sleep. The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. The function of the hypothalamus can be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging, but it is difficult or even impossible to localize activations in the functionally different nuclei. Currently, there are no maps, which inform neuroimaging studies about the microstructural segregation of the hypothalamus in 3D space, while considering variations in individual brain anatomy. This is where the planned doctoral thesis comes in.The project includes the analysis of serial, histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten postmortem brains. Microscopical image analysis and deep learning, in combination with statistical tools of analysis and visualization will be applied to obtain maps of the hypothalamus, which will be brought into a standard 3D space for comparison with functional imaging data. Cytoarchitectonic probability maps will be computed that reflect intersubject variability. One of the brains is the BigBrain, an anatomical model of a human brain, reconstructed at 20 mm isotropic, which allows to develop an ultrahigh-resolution reconstructions of hypothalamic nuclei. All maps will be made available to the scientific community, and are part of the Julich-Brain atlas and the multimodal atlas of the EBRAINS platform developed by the Human Brain Project. There is flexibility to shape the project according to the expertise and interests of the applicant. It is expected that results of the study will be published in high-impact scientific journals.&nbsp;The work takes place in an interdisciplinary team and offers possibilities to present results at internal, national and international meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp;Keywords3D Maps, Image Analysis, Neuroanatomy, Atlasing, CytoarchitectureEntry requirementsMaster in Biology, (cognitive) neuroscience, state exam medicine, or related with excellent gradesLocationCecile and Oskar Vogt Institute, Univ.&nbsp;Hospital D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf, Heinrich Heine University D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf&nbsp;Contact data:&nbsp;C. &amp; O.
