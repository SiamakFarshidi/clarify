To understand the concepts by which the brain operates, large-scale in-vivo sensing of neuron populations has emerged as a key research technique. Microfabricated silicon neural probes have been established as the dominant technology in this field and have reached ever increasing densities and numbers of simultaneous recording electrodes. Thanks to the rapid development of CMOS technology, imec has recently demonstrated a state-of-the-art active microelectrode array with up to 1000 channels, which enables neurologists and researchers to monitor the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electrical activity in great detail.Despite this great progress in neuroscience tools, major bottlenecks to further increase the channel density in CMOS neural probes are the data-transmission bandwidth and the power consumption required to transmit the large amount of raw data. While for some applications access to raw data is an important requirement, brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs) and other clinical applications only require specific information about spike events and their features. By taking advantage of this characteristic, it is possible to think of a new generation of neural probes that are able to record from 1 million neurons at once and only send out the relevant information by exploiting online hardware spike detection and/or data compression.In this project, several online spike-detection and data-compression techniques will be explored in order to implement the most hardware-efficient integrated circuit for the detection and feature extraction of overlapping spikes in real time and with low latency. The circuits and algorithms must be area and power efficient to be implemented on chip and must achieve a considerable reduction of the data rates while maintaining the signal fidelity. The main goal is then to integrate massive multi-channel feature extraction algorithms on chip that enable clinical translation of next-generation neural probes.This is a multi-disciplinary project that requires interest and expertise in several domains:Digital and analog/mixed-signal IC designUnderstanding of BCI theoryNeural signal processing and spike sorting algorithmsData compression algorithmsArtificial neural networksType of work: Signal processing and analysis, IC prototype design and simulation, system integration and evaluation.What we do for youWe offer you the opportunity to join one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.
