Understanding these enzyme complexes requires novel tools that study these enzymes in a native-like lipid membrane environment. The PhD student will carry research leading to a PhD degree, and use membrane biochemistry, bioelectrochemistry and fluorescent microscopy to study transmembrane electron and proton transport on the ensemble and, then, single-enzyme level. The PhD student must be flexible and communicative and able to work in both biochemical and biophysical labs, learn advanced bioelectrochemical methods and use (semi)automated computational analysis of large datasets.Selection CriteriaMaster degree in biochemistry, life-science technology or equivalentProven interest in either membrane protein function, single-enzyme research or bioinorganic chemistryProficient in EnglishExcellent oral and written communication skillsCapable of independent working as well as working in a (interdisciplinary) teamAmbitious with good time-management skills to work effectively towards a long-term goalStart of the project will be between April and September 2022.Our organisationThe Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are committed to expand fundamental knowledge by curiosity and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.The research carried out at the Faculty of Science is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and twelve master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2.300 staff and more than 5.000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bio Science Park, one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.The chemistry and life science research in the Leiden Institute of Chemistry (LIC) is organized around two major research areas: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Chemical Biology\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098Energy &amp; Sustainability\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The institute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research themes illustrate the central position of chemistry between biology, medicine and physics. The various research topics carried out within these themes are ideal for executing interdisciplinary research.For more information, see &nbsp;www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science&nbsp; and&nbsp; https://workingat.leiden.edu/Terms and conditions&nbsp;We offer a full-time position for initially one year. After a positive evaluation of the progress of the thesis, personal capabilities and compatibility the appointment will be extended by a further three years.
