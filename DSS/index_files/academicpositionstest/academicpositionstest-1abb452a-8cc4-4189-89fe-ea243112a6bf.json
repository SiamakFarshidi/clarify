As farming spread from southeast to central Europe, the number of figurines decreased and when agriculture expanded to northern Europe, they had disappeared. The project seeks explanations for the absence of figurines in deep socio-cultural and ritual-religious differences dividing Neolithic Europe in a figurative southeastern part and an imageless northern part. This will include the identification and analyses of shifts in social organization and ritual-religious practices across early agricultural communities in southeast and central Europe.The successful candidate will be part of a small research group consisting of the Principal Investigator and one postdoc and will be based at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, under supervision of Principal Investigator of the project, Associate Professor Rune Iversen.Job descriptionThe PhD fellow will carry out independent research on the central European Neolithic including the Linear Pottery culture and later groups.

The data collection will focus on two main aspects: the presence of figurines and the manifestations of changes in social organization across Neolithic groups. The main task will be to collect and record the relevant data in a custom-made database and help with performing detailed distribution maps in GIS in order to investigate similarities and differences in material culture.
