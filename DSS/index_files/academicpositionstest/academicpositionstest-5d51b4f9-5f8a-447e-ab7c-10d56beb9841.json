The postdoctoral researcher will take part in an upcoming EU Project called TranSensus, which aims at developing a European-wide harmonised transport-specific LCA approach. Through collaboration with the automotive, battery and other important industrial stakeholders as well as key research institutes on this topic, state-of-the-art methodological guidance will be developed in this project to provide fair sustainability assessments for electric vehicles and their supply chains. The focus at Leiden University will be on environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), while social and economic aspects will be considered by partners. Within the project, a variety of mobility scenarios will be developed and assessed over their full life cycle to develop and test a harmonized approach to LCA and LCSA. The ideal starting date would be April-May 2022.Key tasks:Assessment of the state-of-the-art of LCA approaches used in the transport sector in close collaboration with industrial and academic partnersDevelopment of methodological guidance to harmonize the way LCA is performed in the automotive sector.Selection criteriaProfound experience in LCA and good understanding of inventory modelling (including LCI databases) and impact assessmentGood knowledge of the electric vehicles and batteries sectors (e.g. through a Ph.D. in related fields);Motivation to develop harmonized LCA approaches in collaboration with other partners; ability to work in a teamProficiency in spoken and written English and good communication skill.Our organizationThe Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.The research carried out at the Faculty of Science is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organized in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and twelve master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bio Science Park, one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.The Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) is positioned in the Faculty of Sciences. The core focus of CML is to perform research and education in the interdisciplinary field of Environmental Sciences. CML has two Departments: Industrial Ecology (CML-IE) and Environmental Biology (CML-EB). Presently, about 125 fte (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS), Naturalis Biodiversity Centre, and other partners.For more information, see www.science.leidenuniv.nl and&nbsp;workingat.leiden.edu.
