Current projects vary from lens free holographic imaging, hyperspectral imaging and other computational imaging systems that are tuned to specific customer requirements. Such technologies require a multidisciplinary approach within a team that has expertise in software, electronics, optics, and a drive to get things done. To support the growth of these activities, imec is opening a position of Software Engineer within our Integrated Imaging group, in the hyperspectral imaging team.The hyperspectral imaging team is developing novel technology that drastically miniaturizes spectral imaging cameras. This opens a whole new range of applications that were previously assumed unachievable.The team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to further mature and integrate this core technology and enable our customers to develop new applications on top, in fields ranging from medical to agriculture and space. This has already brought non-invasive methods for Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease screening, in-field detection of crop diseases, multi-spectral satellite imaging from CubeSats and more.Software plays a crucial role in the success of our team as it is instrumental in enabling our customers to apply our technology successfully and reliably. To reach this goal, our in-house developed software suite is very heterogenous, ranging from hardware interfaces to evaluation software, demonstrators, and APIs.As lead software engineer in our team, you will significantly contribute to developing and shaping this landscape, driving our roadmap further with a positive impact on the world around us.Your main responsibilities Collaborate with your stakeholders to understand, translate and prioritize feature requests Apply modern collaboration and co-development methods to guide the team during the development phase Spot improvement opportunities and implement in the day-to-day operations Contribute to the design and implementation of new features in our software Work with our hyperspectral camera systems to gain insights and feeling of the software quality and performance Provide training to the team and customers and collect feedback on software and systems Contribute to building demos and demo software to showcase our technology on worldwide events Collaborate with your colleagues to deliver the right quality software on time More information\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on http://www.imechyperspectral.com&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do for youWe offer you the opportunity to join one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.
