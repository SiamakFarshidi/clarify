Employing more than 8,000 people, it is actively involved in education and research, management and administration, as well as technical and social service provision on a daily basis. It is one of the largest, most exciting employers in the area and offers great career opportunities. With 11 faculties and more than 80 departments offering state-of-the-art study programmes grounded in research in a wide range of academic fields, Ghent University is a logical choice for its staff and students.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR TASKS&nbsp;We welcome applications for a full-time PhD position within the Research Group Sustainable Systems Engineering (STEN) of the Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, UGent. The PhD student will be appointed in a fellowship position on the project \"Circular Transition of Offshore Wind Mills Materials or CTO\u00e2\u0080\u009d.&nbsp;A short summary of the CTO project:CTO is a Flemish ICON project, coordinated by Parkwind, and the aim is mainly to prepare the industry for the upcoming End of life (EoL) phase of offshore wind farms. This will be done by assessing the impact over its full lifecycle based upon all three sustainability pillars (economic, environmental and social) and elucidating technical and societal challenges and technology gaps in this EoL phase. The impact assessment framework will cover both existing offshore wind technologies (ex-posteriori analysis) as well as future offshore wind energy technologies (ex-ante analysis). The CTO project aims to address both the EoL challenge as improving the sustainability throughout the lifecycle.&nbsp;The project consists of five work packages: 1) Identification of potential offshore wind energy value chain scenarios and selection of three scenario sets, 2) Assessment of the various offshore operations (installation, O&amp;M and decommissioning) and prioritizing one or two scenarios with alternative offshore operations, 3) Assessment of the material composition and onshore operations (material extraction, manufacturing and EoL) and prioritizing one or two scenarios with alternative material compositions, 4) Prospective sustainability assessment of the selected scenarios, combining material flow analysis (MFA) with a Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA) approach, suitable for both existing as well as future offshore wind technologies, 5) Conclusions and recommendations that may enable implementing a life cycle and sustainability mindset in the development of future windfarms.&nbsp;As the research group STEN is involved in all WPs as described above, your PhD will be built upon these tasks within the CTO project.&nbsp;At least 90% of your assignment will be spent on academic research in preparation of a doctoral dissertation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR&nbsp;Candidates are expected to have an engineering background and/or affinity with sustainability analysis methods such as life cycle assessment. For this project we are looking for someone who is critical, analytical and has a sense of initiative.
