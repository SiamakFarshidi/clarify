Candida albicans is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen which frequently causes superficial or even fatal infections. Phagocytes of the innate immune system are important for defence against fungal infections, but C.&nbsp;albicans can adapt to and evade these immune responses.The successful applicant will use sophisticated in vitro infection models to investigate the interaction of C. albicans with macrophages. Approaches will include assays for fungus-induced macrophage lysis and inflammatory response, fluorescence microscopy, as well as fungal mutant generation and mutant analysis. The overarching goal is to elucidate the pathogenicity mechanisms which lead to escape of C.&nbsp;albicans from macrophages after phagocytosis. More details can be found here.Candidate's profile:Master degree in biology, biochemistry, microbiology or a related disciplineStrong interest in infection biologyEducational background in one or more of the following subjects: microbiology, infection biology, immunology, cell biologyPractical experience in cell culture, fungal molecular biology and fluorescence microscopy is an advantageAbility to perform team-oriented as well as independent workVery good communication skills in English are necessaryWe offer:A multifaceted scientific project hosted by the department Microbial Pathogenicity Mechanisms, a leading research group in fungal infection research with excellent technical facilitiesA place in a young, friendly, international and committed team, with strong local, national and international scientific collaborationsA PhD project embedded in the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Priority Programme SPP2225: EXIT Strategies of Intracellular PathogensParticipation in the structured program of the Jena graduate school International Leibniz Research School or the Jena School for Microbial CommunicationJoining the Leibniz-HKI which is renowned for its research in infection biology and natural products and embedded in the outstanding scientific environment Beutenberg Campus, providing state-of-the-art research facilities and a highly integrative network of life science groupsSalary is paid according to German TV-L (salary agreement for public service employees).
