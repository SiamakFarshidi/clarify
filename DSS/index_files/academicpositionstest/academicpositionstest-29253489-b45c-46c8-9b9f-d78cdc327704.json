BAP-2022-106)You will become a senior researcher in the Building Physics and Sustainable Design Section of the Department of Civil Engineering at KU Leuven which closely collaborates with the EnergyVille research center. The section's research targets heat and mass transfer in porous building materials, durability of (highly insulated) building components, and the energy use and indoor air quality in buildings and the built environment. The project is part of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Flemish Resilience\u00e2\u0080\u0099, a huge investment plan of the Flemish government to restore the economic and social fabric in Flanders after the Corona-crisis. The investment plan is based on seven pillars. The current project \u00e2\u0080\u0098Building a climate neutral Flanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099, with a total budget of 10 MEuro fits within the pillar \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sustainability\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The project will realize a multidisciplinary R&amp;D infrastructure where innovative, replicable and commercially viable solutions for climate-neutral constructions are investigated, optimized and demonstrated. The infrastructure itself will be an exemplary test building with a modular structure of flexible units of different size and equipped with replaceable fa\u00c3\u00a7ade elements. The units will represent dwellings as well as office typologies. The infrastructure will enable a scientific and independent evaluation of energetic, acoustic, durability and sustainability performances of building solutions both for newly built as well as renovated buildings. In this study the holistic approach combining constructive envelope solutions, extensive digitization, intelligent data-driven management and climatization systems and supply from (renewable) energy sources as well as looking for the use and integration of carbon neutral materials and available water resources are key.Website unitResponsibilitiesThe Building Physics and Sustainable Design Section is looking for an enthusiastic and motivated senior-researcher to take the lead in a project that aims at the design and construction of a new large scale test facility for sustainable and carbon neutral building solutions. Your task will consist of supervising the design team, drafting the research roadmaps in collaboration with the main project participants, identifying opportunities within the KU Leuven but also with industrial partners, other research institutes and government.Knowledge of building physics and energy in buildings is essential. Affinity and expertise in experimental and numerical research are similarly valuable.&nbsp;Independence and initiative, reliability in teamwork and good com\u00c2\u00admunication skills are crucial.&nbsp; Finally, a suitable knowledge of spoken and written Dutch is a plus.The project has started, and suitable candidates can start immediately. In your motivation letter, you should clearly state when you could start.&nbsp;&nbsp;ProfileThe project is part of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Flemish Resilience\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the ambitious post-COVID Recovery Plan of the Flemish Government, and focuses more specifically on a sustainable built environment. Within the project a large multidisciplinary test infrastructure will be realized to investigate new technologies to transform the Flemish building stock by 2050 towards carbon neutral and sustainable.The position is open for applicants holding at least a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in one of the following Engineering fields: Architectural Engineering, Civil Engineering, Energy Engineering, Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering with a strong interest and expertise in the field of carbon neutral buildings.
