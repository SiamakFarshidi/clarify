We perform cutting-edge research in the fields of matter and materials, energy and environment and human health. By performing fundamental and applied research, we work on sustainable solutions for major challenges facing society, science and economy. PSI is committed to the training of future generations. Therefore, about one quarter of our staff are post-docs, post-graduates or apprentices. Altogether, PSI employs 2100 people.The Laboratory for Waste Management LES conducts multidisciplinary research in the field of the geological disposal of radioactive waste. LES maintains a unique combination of experimental infrastructure and modelling capabilities for studying radionuclide retention and reactive transport processes in the near\u00e2\u0080\u0090field of cementitious repository systems. The research aspects of waste degradation, reactivity of the barriers, extended interim storage and decommissioning are topics of high relevance in the Swiss waste disposal program. These studies have strong synergies with the fields of environmental engineering, circular economy including carbon capture and sequestration and long-term performance of construction materials.For the development of expert knowledge in the field of \"repository and material chemistry\u00e2\u0080\u009d we are looking for aGroup LeaderCementitious Repository SystemsYour tasksConduct of an experimental research program on the geochemical evolution of underground cementitious repository systems with special focus on near\u00e2\u0080\u0090field chemistry, radionuclide speciation, materials chemistry and nuclear waste degradation processesSupervision of scientific research projects incl. initiation of new lines of research in collaboration with national and international partner research institutesCoaching of experienced scientists, technical staff and early carrier researchers (PhD, Postdocs).
