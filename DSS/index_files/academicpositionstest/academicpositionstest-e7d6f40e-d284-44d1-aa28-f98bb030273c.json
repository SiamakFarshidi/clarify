To create such meshes, powerful parallel mesh generation software must be developed.MissionAtrial fibrillation (AF) remains difficult to treat as the recurrence rate after ablation remains high. This project will look at the influence of structural and electrical heterogeneity on AF at an unprecedented scale, both on triggering and maintenance.The postdoc will create very high resolution atrial models incorporating shape, fibre architecture, fibrosis and electrical remodelling data. A major challenge will be working with the large datasets produced, including their analysis and visualization. The person for this position is expected to have a strong knowledge of both computer modelling/numerical methods and electrophysiology, with a proficiency in analyzing data.Desired profileYou have a PhD and you are specialized in building and running cardiac electrophysiological models. Basic knowledge about meshes would be appreciated.Competences Scientific computing: basic knowledge of computational electrophysiology. Programming: knowledge of at least one of Python, MatLab, C, or C++ Linux environment. Other: fluency in English, ability to draft reports and to work independently.
