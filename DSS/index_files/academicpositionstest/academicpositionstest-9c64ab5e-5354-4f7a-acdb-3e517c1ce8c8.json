Grain and agroforestry legume crops have major unrealised potential for climate-smart transformation of nutritional, income, sustainability and resilience outcomes from smallholder systems in SSA. The LEG4DEV project is led by the National University of Ireland Galway (NUI Galway), in partnership with Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR), University of Hohenheim, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). LEG4DEV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research and innovation activities are focused on Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. We are seeking a talented and motivated researcher to join the LEG4DEV project as a PhD student at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, University Hohenheim to conduct innovative research on assessing the resilience of legume-maize or legume-cassava intercrops under climate change conditions through process orientated modelling approaches. While most past research has been done to explore the adaptation of monocropping systems to different agro-ecological conditions and climate change not much is known for legume based inter- or relay-cropping systems. Additionally, not many crop models are capable of dealing with such integrated cropping systems. The work thus includes a meta-analysis on existing legume-maize/cassava intercrop experimental data and existing modelling approaches and concepts. Subsequently, existing legume-maize or legume-cassava intercrops datasets from our partners (CYMMIT, ILRI, IITA, Wageningen, Uppsala) across different agro-ecologies and/or different contrasting seasons would be used to calibrate and validate a chosen model(s) (incl. our own developed model, LUCIA, lucia.uni-hohenheim.de). Using existing climate change predictions for suitable East-Africa regions growth and soil fertility responses to altered temperature and rainfall conditions would be simulated and uncertainties estimated to test the robustness of intercrops under changing conditions. We are particularly interested in applications from talented and motivated researchers with strong backgrounds in at least one of the fields of agronomy, crop science, soil fertility, climate change, and a strong interest in soil-crop modelling. The successful applicant will have good mathematical and computing skills and be willing to actively interact and collect necessary data with our international partners. The stipend (ca. 50% E13 research position) covers for 4 years of research. We are seeking PhD students who are available to start their research immediately.Application deadline: 04.03.2022Please attach the following documents to your application: Applicants should send an e-mail outlining in less than 200 words your interest and motivations in relation to this position, including; (a) your CV (list grades, interests, experience, skills, etc) &amp; (b) contact details (e-mail + phone) for 3 referees.The University of Hohenheim accepts applications via a secure internet site.
