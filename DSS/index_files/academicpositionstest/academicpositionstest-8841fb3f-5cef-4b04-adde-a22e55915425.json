MorelThis year, Inria is renewing its \"Inria Starting Faculty Position\" (ISFP) offer, designed to strengthen Inria's attractiveness. These positions are based on a unlimited-term contract and are associated with a teaching service in an Inria partner higher education institution (approximately 32 to 64 hours per year). The implementation of this new recruitment system meets a twofold ambition:Enhanced interaction with major research universities.A stronger attractiveness of research careers at the beginning of a career.All candidates may apply for the CRCN competition only, or the ISFP campaign only, or both CRCN and ISFP.The ISFP application files are the same as those for the CRCN competitions and are evaluated according to the same criteria by the same committee. Candidates who have applied for both types of positions and who are selected for an interview will therefore have a unique interview for both positions.Candidates for the CRCN competitions who also wish to apply for the ISFP recruitment campaign must submit the same application for the ISFP offer.Young researchers (CRCN and ISFP)Young researchers (CRCN and ISFP)Researchers \"normal class\" (CRCN) and Inria Starting Faculty Positions (ISFP)To apply, you must first create your applicant area (read more) and download the \"applicant area guide\" below.
