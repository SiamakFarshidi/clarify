We have recently developed an \u00e2\u0080\u009cin-house\u00e2\u0080\u009d quantum transport code of phonons based on the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism [see Ref. 1-3 for more details]. The NEGF approach has been recognized since several years as one of the best-suited methods to realistically describe quantum transport in nano-devices. Based on this code, the PhD candidate will theoretically investigate the heat transport in various technologically relevant systems, like Si/Ge interfaces, semiconductor heterostructures and 2D materials architectures. He/she will have to answer open questions about the transport mechanisms of phonons in those systems and to propose original thermal management solutions.Eligibility criteria of the applicants:Applicants must hold a master degree in physics, material science or electrical engineering. Experience in programming would be appreciated.Funding: 3-year-PhD contractApplication deadline: The 1st of May 2022.For more information, please contact:&nbsp;Dr. Marc BescondIM2NP UMR-CNRS 7334 at the Aix-Marseille University.e-mail:&nbsp;marc.bescond@im2np.frReferences on the topic&nbsp;:Y.
