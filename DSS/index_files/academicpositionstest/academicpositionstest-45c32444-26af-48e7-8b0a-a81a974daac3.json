Current projects vary from lens free holographic imaging, hyperspectral imaging and other computational imaging systems that are tuned to specific customer requirements. Such technologies require a multidisciplinary approach within a team that has expertise in software, electronics, optics, and a drive to get things done. The hyperspectral imaging team is developing novel technology that drastically miniaturizes spectral imaging cameras. This opens a whole new range of applications that were previously assumed unachievable. To support the growth of the activities, imec is opening a position of C++ Software Engineer for the hyperspectral imaging systems within our Integrated Imaging group.The team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to further mature and integrate this core technology and enable our customers to develop new applications on top, in fields ranging from medical to agriculture and space. This has already brought non-invasive methods for Alzheimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease screening, in-field detection of crop diseases, multi-spectral satellite imaging from CubeSats and more.Software plays a crucial role in the success of our team as it is instrumental in enabling our customers to apply our technology successfully and reliably. For this, our software landscape is very heterogenous, ranging from hardware interfaces to evaluation software, demonstrators, and APIs. As a software engineer in our team, you will significantly contribute to developing and shaping this landscape, driving our roadmap further with a positive impact on the world around us.Your main responsibilities Contribute to the design and implementation of new features in our software Be hands-on with our hyperspectral camera systems to gain insights and feeling of the software quality and performance Collaborate with the support team by providing documentation of new features and help in 2nd line support Provide training to the team and customers and collect feedback on software and systems Participate in building demos and make demo software to showcase our technology on worldwide tradeshows Collaborate with your colleagues to define solutions and the plan of attack to everyday problems More information\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on http://www.imechyperspectral.com&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do for youWe offer you the opportunity to join one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.
