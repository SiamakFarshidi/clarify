SR)&nbsp;together with the ERC, will take place on the 23rd&nbsp;of February 2022! You can find all relevant information&nbsp;here.&nbsp;The webinar will also include live Q&amp;A sessions and participation of ERC grantees to share their experiences. Please&nbsp;register now&nbsp;to secure your spot. You will find the webinar program and registration link&nbsp;here.What will the webinar cover?In the webinar we will tell you about the ERC funding opportunities available for researchers interested in working in Slovakia, how to apply for a grant and explain how funding applications are evaluated. You will learn first-hand from current ERC grantees about their experience applying for grants and their best advice to applicants.Prof. Andrzej Jajszczyk, Vice-President of the European Research Council and Chair of the Working Group on Widening European Participation, an ERC Scientific Officer and the ERC National Contact point will take part in the webinar and explain how the ERC is helping to strengthen the participation of researchers in ERC calls from Europe less research-performing regions.The webinar will have&nbsp;live Q&amp;A&nbsp;sessions!Did you know this about the ERC?The European Research Council funds creative researchers of any nationality and age, to run projects based across Europe. The ERC offers four core grant schemes: Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants, Advanced Grants and Synergy Grants. With its additional Proof of Concept Grant scheme, the ERC helps grantees to bridge the gap between their pioneering research and early phases of its commercialization.&nbsp;Researchers from anywhere in the world can apply for&nbsp;ERC grants&nbsp;provided the research they undertake will be carried out in an&nbsp;EU Member State&nbsp;or&nbsp;Associated Country.&nbsp;If you are moving to Europe (EU Member State or Associated Country), you can apply for additional funding, which can total up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.5 million for a Starting Grant, \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3 million for a Consolidator Grant and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.5 million for an Advanced Grant.What type of projects does the ERC fund?Research projects funded by the ERC can last up to five years and can cover frontier research&nbsp;in any scientific domain, including social sciences, humanities and interdisciplinary studies. The&nbsp;grants&nbsp;may help both emerging research leaders ('ERC Starting Grants' and 'ERC Consolidator Grants') and already well-established and recognized scientists ('ERC Advanced Grants').To register for the webinar click&nbsp;here", "requirements_description": "N/A", "conditions_description": "N/A", "employer_description": "The European Research Council\u00c2\u00a0(ERC), set up by the EU\u00c2\u00a0in 2007, is the premiere European funding organisation for excellent frontier research.", "department_description": "N/A", "additional_information": "N/A", "apply_link": "N/A", "employer_link": "N/A", "job_type": "N/A", "logo": "https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMWNcLzY4ZVwvMjFjNjhlMmI4MjViZGM1OTFlNjBlNzYyMDFjMmIwYjQuanBlZyIsImVkaXRzIjpbXX0="}
