This will be clarified in the recruitment process.Research topicThe person hired will carry out their research within the overarching theme: Trust and negotiations in digital service innovation in the public sector.Digitalization in the public sector is often regarded as a driver for transformation in public administration with the aim of creating public value. In this way, digitalization has become a key tool for renewal and service innovation, either in the form of new services or streamlining of existing services. Especially for service innovations, there is a requirement that a new or changed service does not become a one-time delivery but can be delivered to many customers. This requires that knowledge and routines are built in connection with the production and delivery of the service. Furthermore, managers and employees with user or customer contact together with suppliers of digital technology and solutions are particularly key players for service innovations.Digitalization of public services and administration is relevant in various parts of public administration (national, regional and local level). Implementation of digital solutions can be a result of general national policy to be implemented regionally or locally by reform. Digitalization can also take place as a result of inspiration from other contexts with a desire to test similar solutions in one\u00c2\u00b4s own organization.This call is open to various motivations for digitalization. It is desirable that you as a candidate choose a service area / field within the public sector that plans to conduct digitalization, is in process of doing so, or has completed digitalization or digital transformation in its services. We are particularly interested in exploring and understanding how managers and employees in the service meet and respond to policy and/or digital solutions, and what opportunities they have for negotiating and translating this into solutions adapted to their organizational and institutional context.
