Engaged in the fields of energy and the environment for several years, the university participates in the development of new technologies and in a global and multidisciplinary approach essential to understanding, anticipating and supporting energy transformation processes. </p><p>In the current context of climate emergency and energy transition, the UPPA is focusing its research efforts on deepening knowledge in many areas in order to provide the best solutions. For example, research on ecosystem functioning, resource management and the use of low-carbon energy sources are all priority areas of study. To this end, research at UPPA on these themes is carried out in the disciplines of<strong> Science and Technology </strong>(mathematics, geosciences, ecology, oceanography, engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics, etc.) as well as in <strong>Social Sciences and the Humanities </strong>(social sciences, economics, law, geographyâ¦). The theme of energy and environmental transition is therefore a source of innovation for the University and it enjoys high visibility and real interdisciplinarity through its research laboratories and the E2S UPPA project. </p><p>Integrating the <strong>EDENE doctoral programme </strong>within the UPPA thus means becoming an actor of this change by being a creative force on innovative research topics. It is a unique opportunity to develop interdisciplinary and to carry out applied research on the impacts of climate change and on new methods of reducing the massive use of fossil fuels with the aim of increasing the use of low-carbon energy sources for an efficient energy transition and thus contribute to the implementation of a more sustainable environment. </p><p>*UPPA UniversitÃ© de Pau et

The University was founded in 2003 and counts more than 6,700 students and more than 2,000 employees from around the world. The Universityâs faculties and interdisciplinary centres focus on research in the areas of Computer Science and ICT Security, Materials Science, European and International Law, Finance and Financial Innovation, Education, Contemporary and Digital History. In addition, the University focuses on cross-disciplinary research in the areas of Data Modelling and Simulation as well as Health and System Biomedicine. Times Higher Education ranks the University of Luxembourg #3 worldwide for its âinternational outlook,â #20 in the Young University Ranking 2021 and among the top 250 universities worldwide. </p><p>The <strong>Faculty of Humanities, Education and Social Sciences</strong> (FHSE) brings together expertise from the humanities, linguistics, cognitive sciences, social and educational sciences. People from across 20 disciplines are working within the Faculty. Along with the <strong>disciplinary</strong> approach a very ambitious interdisciplinary research culture has been developed.</p><p>The facultyâs research and teaching focuses on <strong>social, economic, political </strong>and<strong> educational</strong> issues with the common goal of contributing to an inclusive, open and resourceful society.

Institutions with the authority to raise funds on financial markets to provide grants, loans or guarantees were present at the outset of the European Communities and part of European responses to the economic crises of the 1970s, the reuniting of Europe in the 1990s and the euro crisis in the 2010s. They are now pivotal to the EUâs COVID-19 response, including the Commissionâs plan to borrow â¬750 billion to help with the costs of the pandemic. This project will generate new evidence on: (1) the evolution and accountability of pan-European public financial institutions since 1950; (2) who drives these developments and what this means for accountability; and (3) how accountable these bodies are in practice and how to strengthen their accountability. Our findings will encourage governments, parliaments, NGOs and pan-European public financial institutions to explore new and stronger accountability practices.</p><p><strong>What we expect from youâ¦</strong></p><ul><li>PhD in political science (political economy), history or a cognate discipline: defence completed successfully by the time of application.</li><li>Fluency in English; a good ability to read in two of following four languages: German, French, Italian and Dutch.</li><li>Experience with archive research preferred.</li><li>Experience interviewing policy-makers on technical issues preferred.</li><li>Background in social science research methods (qualitative and quantitative methods).</li><li>Research background in European Union / European integration studies.</li><li>Proven track record of publications preferred: at least one peer-reviewed journal article accepted for publication.</li><li>Experience working on a short-term (1-3 year) research project with tight deadlines preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>We Offer...</strong></p><p>Excellent salary and work conditions in a global top 300 university.</p><p>Research work on one of the main topics of European economic governance today.</p><p><strong>In Short...</strong></p><ul><li>Contract Type: Fixed Term Contract 24 Month</li><li>Work Hours: Full Time 40.0 Hours per Week</li><li>Foreseen starting date: June 2022</li><li>Location: Belval</li><li>Job Reference: UOL04594 - INTER/UKRI/21/15560511; Acronym: BANK-EU</li></ul><p><strong>How to apply...</strong></p><p>Applications should be submitted online and include:</p><ul><li>Curriculum Vitae</li><li>Cover letter</li><li>Copies of diplomas</li></ul><p>We ensure a full consideration for applications received by 15 January 2022.

Those appointed to doctoral studentships may, however, work to a limited extent with educational tasks, research, artistic research and administration, however, duties of this kind may not comprise more than 20 per cent of a full-time post (Chapter 5, Section 2 of the Higher Education Ordinance).</p><p>In the project \"Illuminate: provably good algorithms for guarding problems\" we study visibility based problems--specifically those, where several stationary or mobile guards need to monitor each point of a domain. These problems play a larger role in an increasing number of applications (e.g., surveillance, illumination and domain covering, and also in manufacturing) and are known to be computationally hard to solve in general. Hence, finding efficient ways to approximate them is important. We consider restricted polygonal domains with the goal to obtain efficient optimal solutions or better approximate solutions than those known for simple polygons. Also we will study k-transmitters: modems that can connect to \"see\" another device that is obstructed by at most k walls. If all points of an environment need to frequently connect to a k-transmitter, we want to find the shortest tour for the transmitter that allows for these connections.<br/>The project is a cooperation between the universities in LinkÃ¶ping and MalmÃ¶.</p><p>The research focuses on the basic geometric properties, worst-case combinatorial bounds, the design and analysis of algorithms and the computational complexity of these problems.</p><p>Additional teaching duties at the department of Computer Science and Media Technology will also be part of the employment.</p><h2><strong>Qualifications</strong></h2><p>Only those who are or have been admitted to third-cycle courses and study programmes at a higher education may be appointed to doctoral studentships (Chapter 5, Section 3 of the Higher Education Ordinance). Preparation of admission to postgraduate education and employment as a doctoral student take place in parallel. Those who have basic eligibility for admission will have:</p><ul><li>passed a degree at advanced level, or</li><li>completed course requirements of at least 240 ECTS, of which 60 ECTS at advanced level, or</li><li>in some other way, in- or outside Sweden, have acquired equivalent knowledge (HEO Chapter 7 section 39)</li></ul><p>Special eligibility is accorded to those who:</p><ul><li>have knowledge and skills equivalent to a second-cycle degree in computer science or in another subject that has relevance for computer science, or</li><li>have acquired essentially equivalent knowledge in or outside Sweden</li><li>are proficient in English to the extent required for conducting postgraduate studies in computer science</li></ul><h2><strong>Assessment criteria</strong></h2><p>When selecting between applicants for vacant positions, the ability to complete postgraduate education is assessed (HEO Chapter 7 Section 5).</p><p>The following general criteria will be used.</p><ul><li>Subject competence</li><li>Scientific quality in previous work</li><li>Methodological and scientific maturity</li><li>Communication and collaborative skills</li></ul><p>The following specific criteria will be used:</p><ul><li>Experience with analysis of algorithms and computational complexity</li><li>Experience with combinatorial and/or computational geometry</li><li>Good programming skills</li><li>Excellent communication skills in spoken and written English</li><li>Documented ability to work collaboratively</li><li>Documented ability to work independently</li><li>Documented ability to meet deadlines</li></ul><h2><strong>Further information</strong></h2><p>Head of department, Bengt J Nilsson, 040-6657244, <a href=\"mailto:bengt.nilsson.ts@mau.se\"><u>bengt.nilsson.ts@mau.se</u></a></p><p>HR-specialist, Sara Eriksson, 040-665 76 59, <a href=\"mailto:sara.eriksson@mau.se\"><u>sara.eriksson@mau.se</u></a></p><p>In our recruitment work, MalmÃ¶ University has taken a stand regarding recruitment channels and marketing.

Initial funding for the position is provided for a duration of 3 years, further extension is possible. </p><p><strong>The topic</strong></p><p>Finite element models for the numerical analysis of large-scale assemblies in the aerospace and automotive industry may comprise hundreds, or even thousands, of joints. In many cases a detailed, fine-scale representation of the connectors and interfaces comprising the joint results in excessive computational and modelling effort. As a remedy, joints are often modelled in an abstracted manner that aims to describe the essential characteristics of the mechanical response in terms of a significantly reduced degree of freedom. Abstract modeling of joints in finite element analysis is a technique widely applied in industrial practice. There, it is typically limited to linear analysis and isotropic materials. The extension of abstract modelling techniques to account for non-linearities resulting from plasticity, damage, friction, and contact is subject of ongoing research. Further challenges arise in the context of anisotropic materials like fiber reinforced composites.</p><p><strong>Tasks</strong></p><p>The position offers an interesting research challenge at the interface of fundamental and applied research. The successful candidate will work on extending the state of the art regarding the abstract modelling of various types of joints in fiber reinforced composite assemblies. </p><p><strong>Employment conditions</strong></p><p>Formal requirements include a scientific university degree (master-level) in engineering, or related fields. The successful candidate will be provided with counsel and support, however, the ability for self-motivated and independent work is essential.

7334</strong></p><p><strong>Funding:</strong> doctoral contract AMU ED353</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>The goal is to manufacture resistive memories (CBRAM) with the co-integration of nonlinear selection elements printed on flexible substrate for sensor applications. To achieve this goal, a design of experiment will be defined in order to process on one hand a CBRAM device and on the other hand a selector with a diode behavior for example. The final goal is to merge both devices at large scale, to design and manufacture a crossbar memory array functionalized with an already existing pressure sensor technology. This original research work will outweigh previous solution in the field [3-8] because of the structural simplicity of the device combined to the exclusive use of printing process or low temperature manufacturing techniques.</p><p>After a bibliography in order to identify the best materials for the electrolyte and the diode, an experience plan will be built for the selection of the best solution in terms of performance and the ease of technological steps. The PhD student will ensure the design, manufacturing and characterization of the memories and nonlinear selection devices. A proof of concept and a demonstrator of a memory array will be realized. The modeling of the electrical/physical behavior of the memory could also be considered. </p><p><strong>Context:</strong></p><p>Microelectronics is undergoing huge changes that are driven by the end of Moore's Law, as well as by several other evolutions: new alternative manufacturing approaches, fast increase of the exchanged/stored data in the world, or the development of new communicating objects. In such a new ecosystem, the development of sensor arrays on flexible media is booming, because they can cover large surfaces, there are easy to produce and have a low environmental impact.</p><p>Because of their simple stack (MIM), resistive memories and especially Conductive Bridge RAM (CBRAM) are compatible with these new concepts: based on the creation/dissolution of conductive filaments within a solid electrolyte from an active electrode, they can be fabricated on flexible substrates, uses active/inert electrodes compatible with inkjet printing techniques, as well as various solid electrolyte that can be fabricated using deposition techniques at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The real benefit of this type of device is also the case of a \"crossbar\" architecture (Fig.1) [1] allowing a selection without complex electronics. However, such architecture requires the co-integration of non-linear selector with memory points. The role of the non-linear selectors is to block the parasitic paths of the current during the programming and the reading phases (Fig. 2) [2].</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/uTmhCWWF2JiwuY1crf76HWczkL7ASFGcQuwljMG6.png\"/></figure><p><u>Fig. 1 [1] : (a) Hybrid integration of a CMOS memory crossbar array </u><br/><u>(b) Diagram of the reading/programming circuit.</u></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:68.17%;\"><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/aQRMAp0mz5IUPVh7uKxYYlv0EJVkIYtJhv4c9nQE.png\"/></figure><p><u>Fig. 2 [2] : Diagram of parasitic paths in a 4-bit memory matrix</u><br/><u>(a) Matrix based on resistive switches (b) Matrix based on resistive switches with rectifier diodes</u></p><p>The development of non-volatile memories associated with a non-linear selection element on a flexible support for pressure sensor applications is thus a key issue and a real challenge at IM2NP. This phD will be supported by the expertise of three research teams of the laboratory â RDI, MCI and MEM (<a href=\"http://www.im2np.fr\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#00B0F0;\">www.im2np.fr</span></a>) to address the four main topics of this subject: materials, printed electronics, memories and sensors.</p><p><strong>Objectives of the thesis:</strong></p><p>The aim of the thesis is to fabricate resistive memories (CBRAM) with the co-integration of non-linear selection elements printed on a flexible substrate that will be functionalized with pressure sensors. This original research work is in the context of the work proposed by [3-8]. The goal will be to fabricate both a single memory point and a diode-type non-linear selection element, in order to have a crossbar type memory matrix which will be functionalized by pressure sensors.</p><p>Resistive memories have a simple MIM stack (Metal-Insulator-Metal). The memory effect is due to the creation/dissolution of one or several conductive path between the electrodes. The presence or lack of this conductive filament makes it possible to code two logic states corresponding to two different resistance values (resistance measured between the two electrodes), called âLRSâ for âLow Resistance Stateâ and âHRSâ for âHigh Resistance Stateâ. Several memory technologies use such concept. The technology used in this study is CBRAM type (Conductive Bridge Random Access Memory) and relies on the growth of conductive filaments from an active electrode (e.g. Silver) up to an inert electrode (e.g. Platinum) through a solid electrolyte (Fig.3) [9]. Such memories have been studied at IM2NP, especially within the ANR Reflex project, within the phD thesis of Charles Rebora [10] and within the HDR of M. Bocquet [11].</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:59.36%;\"><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/tEYwzxezZXhYEthB8hMdlDGsh521057HiRoUObou.png\"/></figure><p><u>Figure 3 [9] : SET (A)-(D) and RESET (E) for a CBRAM memory</u></p><p>Starting from the pristine reset state (HRS), the set process occurs if a sufficient positive bias voltage (SET voltage) is applied to the active electrode. The overall set process involves (i) the anodic dissolution of Ag creating Ag+ cations in the electrolyte layer, (ii) the electromigration of the Ag+ cations within the electrolyte layer, (iii) the reduction of Ag+ to Ag on the vicinity of the inert electrode. This process leads to the formation of metallic filaments that bridge both electrodes. At this step, the memory element is in a low resistance state (LRS, SET). By decreasing the applied voltage, the memory element remains in low resistance state unless a sufficient voltage of opposite polarity (RESET voltage) is applied with a subsequent electrodissolution of the metallic filaments that enable switching back the memory element in a HRS (RESET). </p><p>Various materials can be used as solid electrolyte: inorganic materials (SiO2, GeS, GeSe, Ta2O5, GeSbTe..)[12-13], polymers (PEO, PVKâ¦)[14] or biodegradable materials [15]. In this thesis, a nanoporous inorganic material will be chosen. Indeed, several studies have shown the interest of nano-pores which serve as diffusion path for the cations migration [16] : for example, the use of electrodeposited GeSx [17] allows an accurate control of the Ag doping; fabrication of a CBRAM Ag/Al2O3/CdS/Pt device with good endurance and retention can be obtained using CdS nanoporous thin films (obtained from CdS nanocrystals colloidally synthesized, and a simple drop-drying) [18]. TiOxNy was also successfully tested as porous electrolyte [19]. At IM2NP, the GeSbTe alloy with a 7%vol. porosity was also previously used to fabricated CBRAM cells [20].</p><p><strong>Methodology/ Key issues / IM2NP support</strong></p><p>The realization of CBRAM memories and diodes by printing techniques on flexible substrates will be possible by combining several ambient temperature deposition techniques without any masks or vacuum: inkjet printing, sol-gel, electrochemical deposition thin films, spin-coating. The PhD student will rely on the resources and more specific skills of two teams in the laboratory, the MCI (Micro-sensors and Instrumentation) and RDI (Reactivity and Diffusion at Interfaces) teams, and will benefit from the know-how [21-23] acquired thanks to the technological SPRINT platform (flexible printed electronics platform). The three main technological issues to be addressed during the thesis will be:</p><ul><li>The production of an inert electrode from a material apart from silver by means of printing techniques,</li><li>The deposition of a solid electrolyte layer at the origin of the memory effect by means of printing techniques,</li><li>To ensure the full integration of all the technological steps employed by using only printing or compatible techniques, i.e. ambient temperature, no vacuum and no mask.</li></ul><p>The design and characterization of the memory cells and selectors will be carried out more specifically with the support of the MEM team and the platform Intelligent Object Lab (IO-LAB).</p><p>The thesis work will start with a bibliography review in order to identify potential candidates for the realization of the solid electrolyte layer and diodes. From the few selected materials and associated deposition technologies, a work program will be built in order to select only the best solutions in terms of device performance (memory and non-linear element) and the difficulty of implementing the technological steps. The phD student will then be responsible for the design, production and characterization of the memory cells and the associated selectors. The final objective is the realization of a prototype/demonstrator of a crossbar matrix associating a few memory points and selectors coupled with pressure sensors. The physical modeling of the memories could also be envisaged.</p><p>Teams, departments, platforms involved: DETECT, ACSE, MATER, MCI, MEM, RDI, SPRINT, IO-LAB.</p><p>Staff involved: Marc Bocquet, EvangÃ©line BÃ¨nevent, Magali Putero, David Grosso.</p><p><strong>Candidate profile:</strong></p><p>Student in engineering school or Master 2 in microelectronics.</p><p>Skills in materials and printed electronics will be appreciated.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] K-H.

Its success is associated with the morphotropic phase boundÂ­ary between rhombohedral (Zr-rich) and tetragonal (Ti-rich) compositions, where dielectric and piezoelectric properties exhibit extremes. Besides the intrinsic piezoelectric effect, extrinsic mechanisms related to the presence of domains contribute to the piezoelectric effect in ferroelecÂ­trics. In polycrystalline materials, neighÂ­boring grains interact elastically, piezoelectrically, and elecÂ­trically. The total macroscopic response of a piezoelectric therefore emerges from complex interactions of intrinÂ­sic and extrinsic mechanisms.</p><p>Considering the toxicity of the heavy metal Pb, legislation of the European Union restricts the use of lead in piezoelectric devices unless exempted under specific conditions. Promising lead-free candidates are bismuth layer structured ferroelectrics like bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12) and perovskites such as barium titanate (BaTiO3), bismuth sodium titanate ((Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3), and sodium potassium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3). The families of sodium potassium niobate, bismuth sodium titanate have the advantages of low dielectric constants, high coupling coefficient, and higher mechanical strength, in general, than lead containing ceramics that make them suitable for high frequency transducers. Apart from being nontoxic, their lower acoustic impedance makes them suitable for medical imaging. Bismuth layer structured ferroelectrics ceramics, on the other hand, seem to be suitable candidates as piezoelectric sensors for high temperature. <i>In order to better model the properties and improve the understanding of (lead-free) ferroelectric piezoelectric thin films, it is mandatory to understand the extrinsic mechanisms that are related to domains, domain walls, and their interaction in between each other but also with defects present in the material.</i></p><p><strong>Within this thesis, the successful candidate will study the piezoelectric behavior and domain kinetics in ferroelectric thin films using unique experimental techniques: (i) </strong><i><strong>time-resolved </strong></i><strong>X-ray diffraction during</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>electrical actuation at 3rd generation synchrotrons (ESRF, SOLEIL, â¦) [1-2] and (ii) </strong><i><strong>in situ </strong></i><strong>electrical actuation during TEM imaging using a novel TEM sample holder in an aberration corrected FEI TITAN [3].

The contacts made of silicide (Fig. 1) are essential for the good performance of these transistors and are obtained by reaction between a metal film and the silicon substrate. For microelectronic processes, it is therefore important to understand and control the formation and stability of silicides which takes place by reactive diffusion (diffusion + reaction). </p><p>For the most advanced technologies, metal alloys replace pure metals to improve the final properties of the contact: for example, the Ni(10%Pt) alloy, is largely used since it strongly increases the thermal stability of the NiSi contact.</p><p><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Jsi5XNuwqWLUcEHDOufXjpozJBZU8CBk0UnMvWEH.png\"/></p><p><strong>Fig.  1 : MOS transistors with silicide contacts</strong></p><p><img class=\"image_resized\" src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/79l0DwcIWUjtAJTl0mFWk40ZbhfUm8PR8eYre4oc.png\" style=\"width:39.25%;\"/></p><p><strong>Fig. 2 : Ni-Co-Si phase diagram</strong></p><p>Other alloys are currently being studied but, despite numerous studies on silicide formation [1], several fundamental aspects are still poorly understood, especially in concentrated alloys. In particular, the link between thin film reactions and the ternary phase diagram (Fig. 2) is not well established. The kinetics of these reactions also plays a key role and is generally controlled by the diffusion of metal or silicon in the forming phases. However, the measurement of the self-diffusion (diffusion of the element in the compound) is difficult and requires the use of isotopes. Recently, we measured the diffusion of Si in NiSi using isotope-enriched Si multilayers and the tomographic atom probe (Fig. 3). We have also shown that silicon self-diffusion controls the thermal stability of the Ni silicide [2].        </p><p>The purpose of this thesis is to study the formation of silicides in thin films from concentrated alloys. As Ni and Co silicides are used in microelectronics, the Ni-Co-Si system (Fig. 2) will be studied first and other ternary systems can be defined later. From the experiments, we will try to establish through modeling and simulations the link between kinetics (diffusion) and thermodynamics (phase diagram).</p><p><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/lV5pzNR3huJWJP9PL5q0sqnbpxQUiIr6lgtGOuZY.png\"/></p><p><strong>Fig. 2: Tomographic atomic probe (TAP) showing Si isotopes after dewetting of NiSi on Si substrate [2]</strong></p><p>This thesis will be carried out in the RDI team of the MATER department of the IM2NP which is specialized in thin film reactions and diffusion. This team has many experimental means for both the growth of thin films and their characterization: in particular the Tomographic Atomic Probe (TAP) allows to analyze the materials in 3D and at the atomic scale and to differentiate the different isotopes of the metal and/or Si.   The PhD student will use different experimental techniques for the experiments.</p><p>In particularly, the alloys will be deposited by magnetron sputtering on Si substrates or on layers (or multilayers) of Si28 isotopes (study of Si self-diffusion). Different types of annealing will be applied for the formation of silicides and self-diffusion which will be characterized by measurements of resistance, X-ray diffraction (nature of the phases, texture...) and X-ray reflectivity (thickness, roughness). The diffusion will be studied from the distribution of isotopes measured by atomic probe in 3D and at nanometric scale. Modeling and simulations performed in the team or through collaborations (U. Changsha/China...) will be used to analyze the results. This thesis proposes an original experimental approach based on a unique combination of techniques to study fundamental reaction phenomena in nanoscale materials with applications in microelectronics.</p><p>References :</p><p>[1] D.

We have recently developed an âin-houseâ quantum transport code of phonons based on the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism [see Ref. 1-3 for more details]. The NEGF approach has been recognized since several years as one of the best-suited methods to realistically describe quantum transport in nano-devices. Based on this code, the PhD candidate will theoretically investigate the heat transport in various technologically relevant systems, like Si/Ge interfaces, semiconductor heterostructures and 2D materials architectures. He/she will have to answer open questions about the transport mechanisms of phonons in those systems and to propose original thermal management solutions.</p><p><strong>Eligibility criteria of the applicants:</strong></p><p>Applicants must hold a master degree in physics, material science or electrical engineering.

The hypothalamus is part of the diencephalon that is involved in a variety of functions including the maintenance of the homeostasis, metabolism, stress, the circadian rhythm or sleep. The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. The function of the hypothalamus can be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging, but it is difficult or even impossible to localize activations in the functionally different nuclei. Currently, there are no maps, which inform neuroimaging studies about the microstructural segregation of the hypothalamus in 3D space, while considering variations in individual brain anatomy. This is where the planned doctoral thesis comes in.</p><p>The project includes the analysis of serial, histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten postmortem brains. Microscopical image analysis and deep learning, in combination with statistical tools of analysis and visualization will be applied to obtain maps of the hypothalamus, which will be brought into a standard 3D space for comparison with functional imaging data. Cytoarchitectonic probability maps will be computed that reflect intersubject variability. One of the brains is the BigBrain, an anatomical model of a human brain, reconstructed at 20 mm isotropic, which allows to develop an ultrahigh-resolution reconstructions of hypothalamic nuclei. All maps will be made available to the scientific community, and are part of the Julich-Brain atlas and the multimodal atlas of the EBRAINS platform developed by the Human Brain Project. There is flexibility to shape the project according to the expertise and interests of the applicant. It is expected that results of the study will be published in high-impact scientific journals. </p><p>The work takes place in an interdisciplinary team and offers possibilities to present results at internal, national and international meetings.  </p><p> <strong>Keywords</strong></p><p>3D Maps, Image Analysis, Neuroanatomy, Atlasing, Cytoarchitecture</p><p><strong>Entry requirements</strong></p><p>Master in Biology, (cognitive) neuroscience, state exam medicine, or related with excellent grades</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>Cecile and Oskar Vogt Institute, Univ. Hospital DÃ¼sseldorf, Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf <br/>Contact data: C. &amp; O.

Although many functional elements have been successfully miniaturized and integrated in microfluidic chips, including electrical and optical sensors, the fluidic control still often relies on using external valves and pumps. These peripheral instruments are rather bulky and expensive, resulting in large dead volumes during operation, and -most importantly- they cannot be scaled to large numbers. Hence, to meet the increasing demand for more complex, miniaturized workflows that require multiplexing and parallelization, more integrated solutions are needed. In particular, for the integration of microvalves there is a need to enable integrated microfluidics and biosensing. By applying advanced MEMS/NEMS technologies compatible with state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, the aim is to build an integrated microfluidic platform. </p><ul><li>Perform fluidic/mechanical simulations to design new MEMS/NEMS based valve structures</li><li>Discuss the design and cross-section to develop a CMOS compatible process flow</li><li>Interact with our fab experts to enable device fabrication in imecâs cleanrooms</li><li>Work in synergy with design, microfluidic and characterization teams</li><li>Design measurement schemes and test the functionality of microfluidic devices</li><li>Examine, interpret, and report experimental data to colleagues</li></ul><h2>What we do for you</h2><p>We offer you the opportunity to join one of the worldâs premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.

The Faculty of Computer Science provides cutting-edge teaching and research, intending to put computers at the service of society, taking account of their impact on the environment and respecting the values of solidarity and sustainable development. The Faculty is a founding member of the Namur Digital Institute (NADI), which groups together over 150 researchers in digital technology. It has a multi-disciplinary approach and addresses, in particular, the issues and challenges of computer science in organisations and society. The Faculty of Computer Science has over 400 students, 80 members of staff, including 18 professors and around 50 researchers. Founded in 1968, the Faculty has trained over 1,800 high-level computer science graduates since then.</p><p><strong>Context</strong></p><p>The CyberExcellence project started in January 2022. It aims to position Wallonia as a major player in cybersecurity on the national and international map by developing a core framework allowing the implementation of solutions based on practical and thoughtful cybersecurity with a competitive advantage.</p><p>Among the different axes addressed by the project, Axis 1 aims to secure the system before its deployment through testing approaches. These approaches will be based on techniques derived from artificial intelligence in order, on the one hand, to predict the interesting test cases based on knowledge of the system, its history and the external components used and, on the other hand, to efficiently explore the space of possible states to find interesting new test cases. For example, machine learning algorithms to detect potential flaws and vulnerabilities from the source code, its evolution and the APIs used, and evolutionary algorithms to generate tests and test data (search-based testing algorithms, fuzzing, etc.). These actions can be carried out in collaboration with the ARIAC Artificial Intelligence project funded by the Walloon region. Results will be produced for the two broad classes of cybersecurity testing, (1) cybersecurity functional testing and (2) penetration testing.</p><p>More information: <a href=\"https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/cyberexcellence-projet-recherche-cybersecurite\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/cyberexcellence-projet-recherche-cybersecurite</a> (in French).</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>The position is a 2-years (renewable) contract, funded by the CyberExcellence project.

This research program studies urban development through the optics of urban form, based on a selection of case studies. The program specifically investigates how architectural and spatial approaches can constitute a common platform for different interests and actors, and support strategic planning processes and decisions. This research is based on European traditions of strategic planning as well as research built around architectural and landscape analysis and design understood as critical tools for understanding, exploring and solving complex planning challenges in cities and urban territories.</p><p>This PhD project is part of the Norwegian Urbanism research project and is grounded in investigations of specific cases of municipal planning. Based on examination of existing strategic planning approaches, it should develop and discuss new methods for providing architectural quality and sustainable urban development. The project should build on, and contribute to, theoretical knowledge about international and Norwegian strategic planning practices and research, including more specific morphological perspectives on urban form and landscape. The research should address several of the following themes: </p><ul><li>Surveys of existing analytical approaches and planning tools, and evaluation of their performance, in the selected case studies.</li><li>Investigations into the use of morphological analysis and cartography in projects and planning processes.</li><li>Explorations of how morphological approaches to the built environment can become the basis for new tools and methods within municipal planning.</li><li>Discussions of how international strategic urbanistic projects can inform Norwegian planning practice and theory.</li></ul><p>The PhD candidate will be part of a research and teaching team in urbanism and landscape urbanism operating in a Norwegian context, performing research on practice and research by practice.

The position is available from 1 September 2022 and is part of the research project âA World without Images: Uncovering the absence of figurative representations in Early Neolithic northern Europeâ funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.</p><p><strong>Project description</strong><br/>The overall goal of the project is to explain why figurative representations are missing among Northern Europeâs first farmers. As farming spread from southeast to central Europe, the number of figurines decreased and when agriculture expanded to northern Europe, they had disappeared. The project seeks explanations for the absence of figurines in deep socio-cultural and ritual-religious differences dividing Neolithic Europe in a figurative southeastern part and an imageless northern part. This will include the identification and analyses of shifts in social organization and ritual-religious practices across early agricultural communities in southeast and central Europe.</p><p>The successful candidate will be part of a small research group consisting of the Principal Investigator and one PhD student and will be based at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, under supervision of Principal Investigator of the project Associate Professor Rune Iversen.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong><br/>The postdoc will focus on data collection, comparative analyses and presentation of results. The data collection centres on the southeast European Neolithic including, but not limited to, the StarÄevo-KÃ¶rÃ¶s-CriÅ complex and the Linear Pottery culture. The data collection will focus on two main aspects: the presence of figurines and the manifestations of changes in ritual practices and belief systems across early Neolithic groups. The main task will be to collect and record the relevant data in a custom-made database and perform detailed distribution maps in GIS in order to investigate similarities and differences in material culture. The gathered information will be incorporated into a wider analysis referring to the main projectâs research question.</p><p>The selected candidate is expected to contribute substantially to publications in the research group, oral dissemination of results, organization of an international workshop to be held at the University of Copenhagen and participate in active research environments, including a stay at another research institution.</p><p><strong>Qualification requirements</strong><br/>In order to be considered for the position, applicants must have research qualifications at least corresponding to what can be achieved as part of a successfully completed PhD. The ideal candidate will have a PhD in southeast European Neolithic archaeology. We seek candidates with good interpersonal skills, the ability to organise work independently and to produce state-of-the-art research. Experiences with managing large datasets and familiarity with GIS is an advantage. Furthermore, good skills in spoken and written English is a prerequisite.</p><p>For further details about the qualification requirements for postdocs, please refer to the job structure for Academic Staff at Universities 2013: <a href=\"https://ufm.dk/en/legislation/prevailing-laws-and-regulations/education/files/job-structure-for-academic-staff-at-universities-2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>https://ufm.dk/en/legislation/prevailing-laws-and-regulations/education/files/job-structure-for-academic-staff-at-universities-2013.pdf</u></a></p><p><strong>Salary and conditions of employment</strong><br/>Terms of appointment and salary will be in accordance with an agreement between the Ministry of Finance and The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC).

</strong>Fixed-term contract</p><p><strong>Level of qualifications required : </strong>PhD or equivalent</p><p><strong>Fonction : </strong>Post-Doctoral Research Visit</p><h4>About the research centre or Inria department</h4><p>The Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique Centre is one of Inria's eight centres and has more than thirty research teams. The Inria Center is a major and recognized player in the field of digital sciences. It is at the heart of a rich R&amp;D and innovation ecosystem: highly innovative PMEs, large industrial groups, competitiveness clusters, research and higher education players, laboratories of excellence, technological research institute, etc</p><h4>Context</h4><p>Food industry concentrates a quarter of the recognized work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in France. In such an industry, workers are particularly exposed to physical risk factors (cold, repetitive tasks, heavy loadsâ¦), due to the lack of automatization of strenuous tasks. Among all, cutting/deboning tasks in meat industry are particularly prone to injuries and focus a lot of ergonomic interventions. The industrial project in which this position is funded aims at developing and commercializing a wrist exoskeleton able to assist butchers in the realization of such tasks to minimize their exposure to physical risks of WMSD development. The exoskeleton is actuated with artificial muscles, able to provide a compliant force assistance to the task to be performed. From an initial prototype that served as a proof of concept, the project is developing a fully operational product.</p><p>The project is leaded by a R&amp;D company specialized in the food industry, in charge of the development of the exoskeleton, with in coordination with two other actors that are an industrial meat company - use case provider and integration evaluation - and ENS Rennes â virtual prototyping and biomechanical evaluation.</p><p>The main mission of the recruited post doctoral fellow will be to qualify in biomechanical and ergonomics terms the impact of the successive exoskeleton prototypes on the task (cutting and deboning) realization. This will be done thanks to experimentation in simulated conditions of meat cutting tasks and a motion analysis based on motion capture, EMG and musculoskeletal analysis of the aforementioned tasks.</p><p> This research topic will be carried out in Rennes, the capital of Brittany and the tenth largest city in France, with a metropolitan area of about 720,000 inhabitants. Moreover, with more than 66,000 students, Rennes is also the eighth-largest university campus of France and it has the 2nd highest concentration of digital and ICT firms in France after Paris. Rennes is also known to be one of the most festive and lively cities of France, home of several music and culture festivals. In 2018, the newspaper âL'Expressâ named Rennes as \"the most liveable city in France\".</p><p>The post-doctoral fellow will join the Inria MimeTIC team (https://team.inria.fr/mimetic/), internationally recognized for its multidisciplinary approach to analyse, model and synthesize motion. The candidate will be integrated into a group of about 10 persons working on musculoskeletal simulation and particularly on the CusToM library. The candidate will also have access to unique experimental platforms Immersia and Immermove which offer a high-tech set-up to perform user experiments in real and virtual environments and measure motion (motion capture, EMG, EKG, force sensors, eye trackers).</p><h4>Assignment</h4><p>A post-doctoral fellow will be hired to work full time on the project (12 months) to work at ENS Rennes. His/Her main mission will be the musculoskeletal analysis of the the tasks performed with and without exoskeleton for comparison in biomechanical and ergonomics terms.</p><h4>Main activities</h4><p>He/She will be in charge of two main actions:</p><ul><li>Defining and conducting recurrent experimentations involving meat industry employees, in which meat cutting and deboning tasks will be realized with and without the assistive device</li><li>Defining and conducting a comparative analysis of the impact of the assistive device on the task realization, in biomechanical and ergonomics terms. We particularly focus on approaches such as the maximum acceptable effort to characterize the task in ergonomics terms.</li></ul><p>The post-doctoral fellow will have to manage his/her work within the frame of the projet by retroplanning, team meetings, work presentations and publications.</p><p>Muller, A., Pontonnier, C., Puchaud, P., &amp; Dumont, G.

Applications are in domains like automotive, energy and industry automation, involving technologies like sensors, AI, cybersecurity and computing. Middleware support for CPS is required for their design, providing for abstraction layers for the communication with sensors and actuators, as well as implementation and execution of control loops of the Physical Systems. In CPS collaborative systems, individual CPSs require coordination because of the growing number of nodes and level of autonomy of systems, for which a mastery of modes of local and decentralized cooperation will be needed to exploit the potential of the CPS.<br/>Autonomic, self-adaptive and reconfigurable computing systems are required in smart environments like CPS, because they have the ability to adapt to their environment in order to achieve a set of objectives (e.g., comfort, security and energy savings). This is done by changing their architecture configuration and behavior upon the occurrence of specific events. Building such systems requires to design and implement autonomic feedback loops that collect events and measurements, make decisions and execute the corresponding actions. The design and the implementation of such loops are made difficult by several factors: the complexity of systems with multiple objectives, the risk of conflicting decisions between multiple loops, the inconsistencies that can result from communication errors and hardware failures and the heterogeneity of the devices.<br/>The research takes place in the H2020 project CPS4EU, more particularly in Work Packages concerning CPS collaborative systems, and CPS for use cases. It will be done in cooperation with our industrial partners RTE and ACOEM, and with a former post-doc now at U. Odense, DK.</p><h4>Assignment</h4><p>The objective is to contribute to the software architectures supporting the cooperation and coordination of multiple management and control loops, some concerning the physical systems, others the management of the middleware and the loop processes themselves.<br/>The work will contribute to ongoing work, building upon previous results [1,2] in design frameworks for reliable and self-adaptive systems, where multiple autonomic loops can be composed into complex managers, with application to smart environments.<br/>[1] Mahyar T Moghaddam, Eric Rutten, Philippe Lalanda, Guillaume Giraud<br/>IAS: an IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework<br/>ECSA 2020 â 14th European Conference on Software Architecture, Sep 2020, LâAquila, Italy. pp.1-16<br/>https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02900674<br/>[2] Mahyar T.

or Inria department</h4><p>The Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique Centre is one of Inria's eight centres and has more than thirty research teams. The Inria Center is a major and recognized player in the field of digital sciences. It is at the heart of a rich R&amp;D and innovation ecosystem: highly innovative PMEs, large industrial groups, competitiveness clusters, research and higher education players, laboratories of excellence, technological research institute, etc</p><h4>Context</h4><p>The MimeTIC research team and the INI-CERAH are hiring a postdoctoral fellow for 12 month  at MimeTIC research team, Rennes, France, on the topic of the quantification of the biomechanical demand associated to wheelchair locomotion in various daily situations.</p><p>Locomotion with a manual wheelchair (MWC) generates an important stress on the upper limbs of manual wheelchair users (MWU), that varies according to the environment. To assist MWU to choose the path that best preserve their upper limbs, a cost based on the biomechanical demand of the successive situations along the possible paths must be attributed. In the current accessibility standards, obstacles have no graduation and are only marked as crossable or not. This reflects neither the variety of the situations, nor the link between accessibility and physical or technical abilities of the MWU. To go beyond these limitations, this project aims at defining biomechanical costs attributed to various environmental situations and implementing them in optimal path selection algorithms. This would provide individualized paths to MWU considering their own capacities. To do so, a musculoskeletal model will be developed to quantify biomechanical costs. These costs will be computed for various situations, reproduced in a realistic MWC locomotion simulator developed in the framework of this proposal. Such a project will provide original and useful data for accessibility evaluation, urban development planning and MWC assistance adaptation. It will be the basis for further MWU evaluation and paths characterization to provide personalized cost-optimal paths.</p><p>The project CapaCITIES, granted by the French National Research Agency (ANR), is a collaborative project involving the:</p><ul><li>Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche sur l'Appareillage des HandicapÃ©s (CERAH, Institution Nationale des Invalides)</li><li>MimeTIC Team (IRISA/M2S/INRIA joint team, Rennes France)</li><li>Institut de BiomÃ©canique Humaine Georges Charpak (IBHGC, Arts et MÃ©tiers Sciences et Technologies)</li><li>Laboratoire d'Automatique, de MÃ©canique et d'informatique industrielle et humaine (LAMIH, UniversitÃ© Polytechnique des Hauts de France)</li></ul><h4>Assignment</h4><p> The post-doctoral fellow will be involved in personalized musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, experiments, and data preparation to provide the biomechanical costs of WCH locomotion.</p><h4>Main activities</h4><p>First, he/she will be involved in the development of a comprehensive musculoskeletal model of the upper limb and its interaction with a wheelchair, in collaboration with a PhD student already hired on the project.

A large proportion of the university staff holds doctorates and there is a strong link between undergraduate education and research. SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University has around 11 000 students and 840 employees. SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University is an equal opportunities employer.</p><p>SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University welcomes doctoral proposals in Gender Studies, to be conducted within the interdisciplinary research project: âDigital sexual health: Designing for safety, pleasure and wellbeing in LGBTQ+ communities.â</p><p>This project explores emerging forms of digital intimacy by investigating the rapidly growing field of âsextechâ as promising tools to enable sexual health in LGBTQ+ communities. Sextech includes everything from educational platforms for health information and consultation, to sexual wellness apps for self-tracking and sharing sexual health data, to chatbots that teach users âsextingâ or engage in candid conversations about STIs and HIV, to smart sex toys. Building on an international collaboration involving a research team in Sweden and Australia â including partnerships with local sexual health professionals, governmental agencies, LGBTQ organisations and sextech designers â the project develops an empirically grounded, theoretically inventive framework for future sexual health intervention. By bringing together users and sextech developers, the project also explores new forms of safe processing of intimate data in digital health initiatives, as well as ethical and inclusive tech design for LGBTQ+ people.</p><p><strong>Gender Studies</strong> at SÃ¶dertÃ¶rn University is an expansive, internationally well-connected field of research and teaching which seeks to advance new forms of interdisciplinary knowledge. The research focus is on developing feminist theory and methods, as well as on critical studies of power in relation to contemporary and historical formations of gender. Gender Studies offers interdisciplinary perspectives on the formation and transformation of gender and its intersections with other power structures, such as race, sexuality, class, and nationality and an interest in how such intersections become meaningful and materialise in various historical, geographical, political, social and cultural contexts. </p><p>Doctoral studies at the Department of Gender Studies is part of the research area of<strong> Critical and Cultural Theory</strong>, which is an interdisciplinary research environment with seven subjects in the humanities. Research focuses on critically motivated studies of cultural artefacts and human practices. </p><p><strong>Description of the doctoral position</strong></p><p>The successful applicant will write their thesis as part of the âDigital sexual health: Designing for safety, pleasure and wellbeing in LGBTQ+ communitiesâ research project. The field of sextech includes a wide variety of intimate digital media; specific empirical settings or materials are to be proposed by the candidate. We welcome submissions from applicants with a variety of research interests and previous research experience in the areas of digital media and digital intimacy, sexual health and sexual rights, LGBTQ+ communities and sexual politics, and participatory, future-oriented approaches to tech design. While all sub-communities under the LGBTQ+ umbrella are relevant to the project, priority will be given to doctoral projects that emphasise trans and non-binary communities and/or communities of gay men in relation to digital sexual health. The study will be carried out in Sweden and build on qualitative empirical work. The applicant thus needs to be able to conduct qualitative research in Swedish.</p><p>For more information about the âDigital sexual health: Designing for safety, pleasure and wellbeing in LGBTQ+ communitiesâ research project, please contact the project manager (see below).</p><p>For complete information regarding the position, please visit the following link: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.sh.se/english/sodertorn-university/meet-sodertorn-university/this-is-sodertorn-university/vacant-positions\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sh.se/english/sodertorn-university/meet-sodertorn-university/this-is-sodertorn-university/vacant-positions</a></p><p><strong>Further information</strong></p><p>Jenny SundÃ©n, Professor of Gender Studies, project manager, <a href=\"mailto:jenny.sunden@sh.se\">jenny.sunden@sh.se</a>, +46(0)8 608 4577</p><p>Ann Werner, Director of Studies (third cycle), Department of Gender Studies, <a href=\"mailto:ann.werner@sh.se\">ann.werner@sh.se</a>, +46 (0)8 608 4566</p><p>Alexandra Blomstedt, Human Resources Officer, School of Culture and Education, <a href=\"mailto:alexandra.blomstedt@sh.se\">alexandra.blomstedt@sh.se</a>, +46 (0)8 608 4683 </p><p><strong>Application deadline: </strong>11 March 2022 at 23:59</p><p><strong>Welcome with your application! </strong>On our website, <a href=\"http://sh.se/vacantpositions\" target=\"_blank\">sh.se/vacantpositions</a>, there is an application template that the applicant needs to follow.

Researchers in this multidisciplinary team share the aim of gaining detailed understanding of activities as they are actually accomplished in natural situations or else in ecologically valid experimental situations. This methodological approach to activities in situ facilitates close collaboration with researchers in information and communication sciences and engineering.</p><p>The recruited person will contribute principally to the research topic âDesign and Creativityâ of INTERACT, that addresses the socio-cognitive, affective and technical processes involved in design, as well as experimentation with new situations, methods and approaches for creativity. Within a non-deterministic approach to creativity, this research aims to understand facilitating conditions, mediating tools and representational supports (physical, digital and hybrid) in different domains, such as: visualization and understanding of situated data, identification of spaces for innovative design, design by usages and by users, appropriation of territories and spaces, anticipation of future uses by design.</p><p><strong>DESIRED SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE</strong></p><p>The person recruited will mobilize theoretical and methodological frameworks in one or (preferably) both of the following domains: Applied Psychology, and Interaction Design. A multidisciplinary profile will be highly appreciated. The research activities of the person recruited will be centered on design and creativity, with an approach based on qualitative/quantitative analysis of the design activity and the development of sociotechnical supports for it. Approaches such as âresearch through designâ and âparticipatory designâ will be particularly appreciated. Such research will address the roles of digital technologies from the points of view of usages and design strategies, in a variety of domains, including but not limited to: ecological transitions of society, sustainable development, cities and mobilities of the future, digital design, civic tech and citizen deliberation.</p><p>The researcher-teacher will make a significant contribution to teaching in the SES Department, principally in collective teaching for the first year of engineering students (last year of licence), in the common core and in teaching relating to design activities and methods in the IP Paris masters courses. These courses involve teaching design methods (user-centred, participatory) and creativity, supervising projects on design of digital technologies, the impact of the digital on human activities and qualitative research methods. The teacher-researcher could also develop new courses depending on his or her scientific expertise.</p><p><strong>JOB DESCRIPTION</strong><br/><strong>MAIN MISSIONS OF THE

Marseille Cedex 20, France</p><p><u>Subject description: </u></p><p>Global warming and the exhaustion of fossil energy sources are well-known major issues that have become urgent to tackle. A joint-attack is needed including consumption reduction and development of renewable energies among which the photovoltaic (PV) solar electricity will play a major role, provided that significant progress in terms of efficiency, cost reduction and reliability are achieved.  Among the mass production of materials used to produce solar cells, single or multi-crystalline silicon (Si) ingots still dominate the market. For all fabrication processes without exception, the grain boundaries, dislocations, and impurity contamination control during the solidification step remains a major challenge to improve the electrical properties [1]. Impurities play a major role as they not only modify grain nucleation and competition during solidification [2, 3], but they are at the origin and/or interact with structural defects, ultimately degrading the cell conversion efficiency [4]. The furnace environment and crucible are responsible for most of the light impurity contamination and in some cases for metallic impurity contamination. In addition, impurities can be found in the starting feedstock used for PV applications all the more in the case of the research and industry focusing on recycling of solar cells which is fast developing [5]. </p><p>Therefore, a thorough understanding of the crystallization mechanisms, of the formation of defects at different scales (from dislocations to grains) and of the complex interaction between growth defects and impurities is needed to control these phenomena during solidification processes. Dislocation dynamics during seed heating (Figure 1.a) or while propagating in the ingot during solidification and dislocation interaction with the solid-liquid interface are some of the main issues which are far from being fully understood. Another major key-issue is the interaction of the grain boundaries with dislocations [1] and small angle grain boundaries (SAGBs) [6]. </p><p>Recently the MCA (auto-organised growth microstructures) team has demonstrated the effect of carbon (C) on the final grain structure: it is constituted by a higher proportion of high order twins and of random angle grain boundaries compared to the case of low C contaminated samples. Moreover, local deformations are induced by the presence of silicon carbide precipitates, which are at the origin of SABGs formation (Figure 1.b). However, further work is needed to better understand the effect of C and other light impurities on grain nucleation and on the related deformation of the crystal structure. Contamination by silicon nitride is another major subject as it is used as crucible coating in the solidification processes. Its effect on first stages of silicon nucleation [7], on grain structure formation, development of structural defects and electrical properties needs to be further studied. As concern metallic impurities, no significant effect on the grain structure is evidenced in the presence of Cu although it induces a destabilization of the solid-liquid interface (Figure 1.c). Iron is another major metallic impurity that is largely responsible for the red-zone (degraded PV properties) in ingots and which effect on grain formation, solid-liquid interface shape and electrical properties needs to be evaluated in details, and to be compared to the case of Cu contamination.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://ap-production-media-archive.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/s7GHqzr4FU7jl8KYt7ig2yuGGshFLsy7ZMupBDxL.png\"/></figure><p><i>Figure 1. a) In situ X-ray imaging of dislocations in a Si sample during heating. b) Peak position map obtained by RCI (Rocking Curve Imaging) and revealing SAGBs in a Si sample contaminated with C. c) In situ X-ray imaging of the solid-liquid interface of a Si sample contaminated with Cu [3]. </i></p><p>In order to answer to these up-to-date issues, the objective of the PhD research work will be to contribute to the understanding of the growth mechanisms, of the structural defect formation (dislocations, twins, SAGBs) and of the interaction of these defects in the presence of relevant impurities selected among light and metallic impurities. To reach these objectives, the PhD student will carry-out and analyse, <i>in situ </i>and time-resolved experiments in a unique device named GaTSBI (Growth at high Temperature observed by X-ray Synchrotron Beam Imaging) developed by the MCA team and run at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), a large European equipment. GaTSBI is constituted of a high temperature (up to 1800Â°C) directional solidification furnace coupled to X-ray imaging. The latter allows studying the shape and dynamics of the solid-liquid interface, the formation and developments of structural defects and of the deformation of the crystal structure [8] <i>in situ </i>during heating of the seeds, solidification and cooling down. The PhD student will also implement <i>ex situ</i> complementary characterisation techniques of the grain structure (EBSD - Electron BackScatter Diffraction), of defects and deformation (RCI-Rocking Curve Imaging [9]), of impurities (TEM, SIMS), or of the electrical or PV properties. </p><p>The PhD work will be conducted at <a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr\" target=\"_blank\">IM2NP</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr/equipe-microstructures-de-croissance-auto-organisees-mca\" target=\"_blank\">MCA team </a>of the <a href=\"https://www.im2np.fr/fr/departement-structure-et-chimie-des-materiaux\" target=\"_blank\">Mater Department (Structure and chemistry of materials)</a> in collaboration with: the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), the MSMP (Mechanics, Surface, Materials and Processes) laboratory and the NTNU (<a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology). </a></p><p><u>Funding:</u> Doctoral contract (salary)</p><p><u>Keywords:</u> silicon, photovoltaic, X-ray imaging, solidification, impurities, grain boundaries, dislocations, precipitates, twinning.</p><p><u>References:</u></p><p>[1] G.

The study of works in translation is especially important in introducing students, through literature, to other cultural perspectives. </span></p><p><strong>Applicants must have:</strong></p><ul><li>a degree or equivalent in the subject (or a related subject) for which they are applying,</li><li>a minimum of one yearâs experience teaching the subject (or a related subject) to students in an appropriate age range:<ul><li>16 to 19 years of age â DP</li><li>applicants who are no longer teaching must have taught or examined within the last three years</li></ul></li><li>access to the internet, via a broadband (or faster) connection, in an environment that is suitable for marking confidential assessment material</li></ul><p>IB teaching experience is not essential.</p><p>For more information and to apply, please visit our website:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ibo.org/examiners\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ibo.org/examiners</a></p>\n</div>","requirements_description":"N/A","conditions_description":"N/A","employer_description":"N/A","department_description":"N/A","additional_information":"N/A","apply_link":"N/A","employer_link":"N/A","job_type":"N/A","logo":"https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiIyMDE2XC8xMVwvaWItbG9nby5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6W119"},{"_index":"academicpositions","_type":"_doc","_id":"https://academicpositions.com/ad/universite-catholique-de-louvain/2022/post-doctoral-position-in-human-tumor-immunology-and-bioinformatics/174538","_score":1,"url":"https://academicpositions.com/ad/universite-catholique-de-louvain/2022/post-doctoral-position-in-human-tumor-immunology-and-bioinformatics/174538","title":"Post-Doctoral Position in Human Tumor Immunology and Bioinformatics","publish_date":"2022-01-27","deadline":"2022-02-28","location":"Place de l'UniversitÃ© 1 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium","city":"Place de l'UniversitÃ© 1 Louvain-la-Neuve","country":"Belgium","position":"Postdoc","field":"Bioinformatics, Biomedicine, Biostatistics, Cancer Research, Cell Biology, and 5 moreClinical Sciences,Computational Biology,Immunology,Molecular Biology,Oncology","salary":"N/A","max_working_hours":"N/A","employer":"UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain","job_description":"N/A","requirements_description":"N/A","conditions_description":"N/A","employer_description":"N/A","department_description":"N/A","additional_information":"N/A","apply_link":"N/A","employer_link":"N/A","job_type":"N/A","logo":"https://content.academicpositions.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1lZGlhLWFyY2hpdmUiLCJrZXkiOiJjMzlcLzYyNVwvYzM5NjI1NmU5NTg5YjI4MzIzZjU2YzY4MjE3NTU1NWUucG5nIiwiZWRpdHMiOltdfQ=="},{"_index":"academicpositions","_type":"_doc","_id":"https://academicpositions.com/ad/oslo-metropolitan-university/2022/msca-2022-calls-for-expression-of-interest-in-sustainable-societies-in-the-21st-century-from-welfare-states-to-eco-social-states/174722","_score":1,"url":"https://academicpositions.com/ad/oslo-metropolitan-university/2022/msca-2022-calls-for-expression-of-interest-in-sustainable-societies-in-the-21st-century-from-welfare-states-to-eco-social-states/174722","title":"MSCA 2022 -

The position will contribute to research on the role that interaction design plays in supporting intersecting issues of health, social and environmental justice. It seeks to explore feminist posthumanities theories and more-than-human design approaches that attend to and design-with the relations between human bodies and the environment. The PhD position will research this in the context of health and wellbeing, by inquiring into the social, cultural, and ecological dimensions of health technologies, and by designing technologies that nurture caring practices for humans and the Earth.</p><p>The PhD will explore a designerly and theoretical feminist lens on care that requires a speculative commitment to neglected relations which have often been taken for granted or rendered invisible. Such neglected relations, that may be connected with social justice and/or climate change, often disproportionately effect the health and well-being of marginalized communities. This position will seek to use design to render visible and support neglected care relations and amplify the work of marginalized people as agents of change, with the goal of researching how technologies of care can be designed for more equitable and sustainable futures. The PhD will include critical and curious hands-on experimentation with new technologies and materials used in health care, such as biodesign, body-based soft technologies, and machine learning, to design concrete exemplars of what inclusive and sustainable technologies of care could look and feel like. </p><p><strong>The PhD could include projects such as:</strong></p><ul><li>Designing climate wearables: body-based environmental monitoring</li><li>Crafting care through textile, knitting, weaving, and soft robotics</li><li>Designing justice-oriented and community-led health practices</li><li>Biodesign and the use of biomaterials in the design of medical/health technologies</li><li>Speculative fabulations and Arctic futures of human health and climate crises</li><li>Feminist programming and data feminism practices for human and planetary health</li></ul><p>For more information on this research program, please visit <a href=\"http://www.ahophdlive.com/inclusive-and-sustainable-design\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.ahophdlive.com. </u></a></p><h2>About the candidate</h2><p><strong>Formal requirements </strong></p><ul><li>The candidate should have a masterâs degree in design, art or a technical discipline, such as interaction design, industrial design, human computer interaction, digital art, software studies.

The center is a top-level scientific institute with an extensive network of international collaborations in Europe and the rest of the world.</p><h4>Context</h4><p>We are looking for a post-doc or engineer for a short position of 6 months to work in the CPS4EU European project ending in june 2022, and contribute to ongoing work [1,2] on self-adaptive computing in Cyber Physical Systems, in cooperation with industrial partners of the project.</p><p>Context</p><p>Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that create a link between physical and digital worlds and enable cooperation among systems. Applications are in domains like automotive, energy and industry automation, involving technologies like sensors, AI, cybersecurity and computing. Middleware support for CPS is required for their design, providing for abstraction layers for the communication with sensors and actuators, as well as implementation and execution of control loops of the Physical Systems. In CPS collaborative systems, individual CPSs require coordination because of the growing number of nodes and level of autonomy of systems, for which a mastery of modes of local and decentralized cooperation will be needed to exploit the potential of the CPS.</p><p>Autonomic, self-adaptive and reconfigurable computing systems are required in smart environments like CPS, because they have the ability to adapt to their environment in order to achieve a set of objectives (e.g., comfort, security and energy savings). This is done by changing their architecture configuration and behavior upon the occurrence of specific events. Building such systems requires to design and implement autonomic feedback loops that collect events and measurements, make decisions and execute the corresponding actions. The design and the implementation of such loops are made difficult by several factors: the complexity of systems with multiple objectives, the risk of conflicting decisions between multiple loops, the inconsistencies that can result from communication errors and hardware failures and the heterogeneity of the devices.</p><p>The research takes place in the H2020 project CPS4EU, more particularly in Work Packages concerning CPS collaborative systems, and CPS for use cases. It will be done in cooperation with our industrial partners RTE and ACOEM, and with a former post-doc now at U. Odense, DK.</p><h4>Assignment</h4><p>The objective is to contribute to the software architectures supporting the cooperation and coordination of multiple management and control loops, some concerning the physical systems, others the management of the middleware and the loop processes themselves.</p><p>The work will contribute to ongoing work, building upon previous results [1,2] in design frameworks for reliable and self-adaptive systems, where multiple autonomic loops can be composed into complex managers, with application to smart environments.</p><p>[1] Mahyar T Moghaddam, Eric Rutten, Philippe Lalanda, Guillaume Giraud<br/>IAS: an IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework<br/>ECSA 2020 â 14th European Conference on Software Architecture, Sep 2020, LâAquila, Italy. pp.1-16<br/><a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02900674\" target=\"_blank\">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02900674</a></p><p>[2] Mahyar T.

description </h3><p><strong>A position of first</strong> <strong>assistant</strong>, in the field of <strong>Environmental evaluation in bioengineering,</strong> attached to the <strong>Gembloux Agro-Bio </strong>Tech Faculty (single department).</p><p>Our society is embarking on an environmental transition that should aim to reduce or compensate for the damage caused by anthropogenic pressures (climate change, pollution and scarcity of resources). This will involve the development of new production routes and processes that have been proven to minimise their environmental footprint through quantified assessment. Bioengineers have a role to play in this transition process as highlighted in the conclusions of our forward-looking workshops dedicated to the challenges facing bioengineers in 2030. This is also reflected in the objectives of Walloniaâs smart specialisation strategy (Strategic Innovation Areas), which emphasise reducing the energy and environmental impact of its food production. For the bioengineer, the subject is complex because it covers processes from production through to the end of the transformation chain.

Devices for neuromodulation for example, form a fast-growing market due to strong needs in pain modulation, or to support patients with Parkinson disease, stroke, or other aging-related disorders. Today's commercial technologies do not offer the resolution needed to finetune stimulation of neuronal circuits, nor scaled packaging techniques that enable very tiny sensoric implants, and thus therapy success rates are very variable. The existing device packaging techniques are often resulting in a rather bulky and rigid implant which is very intrusive in the human body. Miniaturization of electronic implants is very important: it allows for implantations in small or sensitive areas of the body without being very invasive. As such, miniaturized electronic implants enable better therapeutic treatments, as well as very novel therapies helping patients with currently untreatable disorders.  Imec is addressing this need for tiny electronic implants through the development of a novel biocompatible packaging technology within its so called FITEP platform (FITEP: Flexible Implantable Thin Electronic Packaging). Furthermore, with respect to neuromodulation, imec is developing chips that allow interfacing with the nervous system with high resolution. Imec is performing also research on other small sensoric devices which need a miniaturized biocompatible packaging. </p><p>In this postdoc project, the candidate will evaluate packaging and electrode options for scalable manufacturing of implants. The candidate will screen imecâs novel packaging technologies, characterize hermetic sealing concepts, and explore novel electrode materials for the use in imec's neurotechnology projects. Next to performing various measurements on existing test structures, the candidate will be required to fabricate novel structures, hence microfabrication of devices in the clean room will be an important part of the work. Most of the work will be done within the CMST team of imec (CMST: Centre of Microsystems Technology, an imec-associated lab in Ghent), where the FITEP platform is under development. Some part of the characterization will be done at imecâs head quarters in Leuven, in the frame of the existing collaboration of CMST with the Lifescience department of imec.</p><h2>What we do for you</h2><p>We offer you the opportunity to join one of the worldâs premier research centers in nanotechnology at CMST, an imec-associated lab in Ghent, Belgium.

However, the analytic methods to solve such equations rely on methods that discretize time with equal steps. Euler and Rung-Kutta are well-known examples, they discretize the time space to compute the state trajectory. Unfortunately, these methods collide with the complexity of the modelled system whose increase the computation time and memory size needed to solve the problem. In addition, they are approximation and induce often a rate of errors unacceptable in comparison to the state trajectory of the real system under steady.</p><p>The formalism Generalized Discrete Event System Specification (GDEVS) known to be a generalization of Discrete Event System Specification formalism allows the modelling of the dynamics of continuous systems using polynomial functions. Such a formalism provides a faithful representation of hybrid systems where the discrete approach driven by events quotes with the continuous approach which allows to compute the state of the system between the occurrence of two successive events.</p><p>Few works were interested to checking formally hybrid systems. This is due to the dynamics of such systems which is not possible to describe using a state machine or an underlying formalism. In addition, such a topic covers two different communities of scientists: software systems and continuous systems where the goals of modelling are totally opposed.</p><p>These works of thesis will provide answers to relevant questions such as the legitimacy of hybrid systems for simulation by verifying the absence of algebraic loops. Such a verification will guarantee that the simulation will execute a finite number of transitions for a given time interval. Other verifications related to the system environment will be possible. For example, does the system always ensure the control of its elements? Is any transition always possible? Etc.</p><p>A second aspect of this work that seems interesting to develop is the self-adaptability of hybrid systems in the face of a new context (environment).  Knowing that work has been done at the macroscopic level (DS-DEVS), work at the microscopic level remains to be developed. For example, how to define a set of transitions that will allow to go back to the initial state? How to define a set of transitions that will allow to correct an error? Etc.</p><p>Therefore, these works will allow, at the end, defining a formal framework for the modelers of hybrid systems.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>- Alur, R.: Formal versification of hybrid systems.

This innovative strategy is part of the Instituteâs first-class scientific investment plan, which aims to accelerate and boost the implementation of its strategic plan for 2030 and contribute to the objectives of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).</p><h4>A Blue Chair project for the Idian Ocean in 2022</h4><p>The seismic-volcanic crisis affecting the department of Mayotte for the last three years is a remarkable terrain for studying the sea-land continuum and assessing the impacts of the ocean on coastal socio-ecological systems.</p><p>Ifremer is already present in the Indian Ocean and has been involved in work to observe and understand the current seismic-volcanic phenomenon, including the effects of these natural disturbances on the different sectors of the socio-ecological system. The ScInObs and MARMOR projects provide an unprecedented opportunity to deploy a specific programme on this issue in Mayotte.</p><ul><li>The MARMOR project is closely linked to the actions carried out in response to the seismo-volcanic crisis in Mayotte, which are structured at the national level with REVOSIMA (REseau de surveillance VOlcanologique et SIismologique de Mayotte) to monitor volcanic and seismic activity in the region.</li><li>The Mayotte underwater observatory system to be developed over the coming years within the scope of ScinObs</li><li>alongside MARMOR is designed to serve as a multidisciplinary platform for advanced research and long-term monitoring. It will address active volcanic and tectonic processes and their consequences on the biogeochemical composition of seawater, the emergence of life on a new volcano, and the evolution of marine ecosystems in response to large-scale deep eruptions and associated gas emissions. The deployment of this system will be associated with oceanographic exploration campaigns in the area and processing of the data acquired in the framework of REVOSIMA to produce precise mapping of the sector, including associated active processes and marine habitats.</li></ul><h4>Sea-land continuum in Mayotte</h4><p>In view of the scientific and societal issues associated with the seismic-volcanic crisis in Mayotte and the observation resources in place, Ifremer is looking to open a research chair devoted to the sea-land continuum in the Indian Ocean. This chair will be supported by human resources (thesis students, post-doctoral students, and civic service volunteers) and an operating budget. It will also benefit from facilitated access to the sea through exploration projects currently in preparation. This call for applications seeks to convene research axes combining two complementary approaches:</p><ul><li>A volcano-perspective research axis, aiming to provide answers to the problems related to the seismo-volcanic crisis. Topics could include: the functioning of the dynamics of this event in terms of seismicity and fluid circulation, changes in the biogeochemical cycles of the water column and spatial and temporal dynamics, impacts of fluid emissions on benthic and pelagic communities, a study of the drivers of the emergence and development of life on the newly formed volcanic substrates, impacts on fisheries and marine fauna</li><li>A Mayotte-perspective research axis, which will address the consequences of the seismic-volcanic crisis on the protection of populations, the preservation of resources, and the raising of awareness among populations. This component will integrate the human and social sciences within the framework of a multi-disciplinary approach.</li></ul><p>The work and results of these axes will take part in the definition and implementation of scientific mediation measures in the framework of this Chair.</p><p>The expected candidate will have nationally and internationally recognised skills in his/her field. He/she will demonstrate his/her capacity through his/her career to lead an ambitious project in coordination with other projects and with the ability to manage the project whilst occasionally being absent from the development site.</p><p>His/her previous work will express a form of acculturation to interdisciplinarity and interest in observation and monitoring issues. The candidate will also have the capacity and desire to articulate two worlds: that of natural science with that of human and social sciences, around the impacts of an extreme natural phenomenon on an island and its population. He/she will additionally interact with the territorial authorities and the State departments in Mayotte.</p><h4>Terms of the Call for applications</h4><p>Candidates will have a minimum of 4 years of post-doctoral experience. The laureate of the Chair will be awarded funding for a maximum of 5 years, which will cover the salaries of the laureate, at least one doctoral candidate and one post-doctoral candidate, operating costs, and possible investment costs.</p><h4>Constitution of the application</h4><p><strong>Applications in English must include the following completed documents:</strong></p><ul><li>Application proposal 6 pages maximum (without annexes)</li><li>Curriculum vitae of the candidate, stating his/her professional and administrative situation at the time of submission of the project,</li><li>List of publications and significant works from the last 5 years,</li><li>At least two letters of recommendation.</li></ul><p><strong>The application should include:</strong></p><ul><li>The scientific objectives and challenges set by the Â«volcano perspectiveÂ» and Â«Mayotte perspectiveÂ» research axes</li><li>Areas of innovation and those related to societal expectations</li><li>Project methodology including a proposal for scientific mediation</li><li>Description and use of necessary resources and means</li><li>Local, national, and international collaboration</li></ul><p>For Ifremer to anticipate the administrative arrangements for the implementation of the Chair, by adapting them to the situation of the successful candidate, candidates will provide their administrative situation and the conditions and constraints that may accompany their application.</p><h4>Selection of candidates</h4><p>The selection of candidates will be based on an application to be submitted to Ifremerâs Scientific Directorate before 31 March 2022 - <a href=\"https://wwz.ifremer.fr/en/Latest-news/Call-for-applications-Ifremer-kick-starts-its-second-Research-Blue-Chair\" target=\"_blank\">marie.casse@ifremer.fr</a></p><p>The project must be submitted on time, in the requested format, and complete with all constitutive documents. A board of internal and external experts will carry out the selection process. Final adjudication will take place on 01 July 2022.

Green chemistry is therefore a progressive paradigm shift in the practice of chemical sciences, with a desire to position the environment, safety and human health as pillars for reflection and action. Green chemistry addresses the drivers of development, whether these be in the materials, health or energy sectors, as highlighted in the United Nationsâ Agenda 2030 goals. It is also a theme that has been identified as a priority in the European Commissionâs agenda (H2020 and BBI), as well as in the Walloon Governmentâs recovery plan.</p><p><u>Teaching activities</u></p><p>Teaching activities include the coordination and supervision of practical work sessions in chemistry (Masterâs level bioengineering or towards the end of the Bachelorâs bioengineering programme in the <i>Chemistry Bio-industries </i>stream), in a balanced way for both the <i>CABS</i> and <i>SMARTECH </i>Faculty areas. Teaching will particularly relate to providing support to the practical teaching of the following courses: CHIM0722 <i>(extraction, purification, characterisation of biosourced molecules</i>), CHIM9254-1 and CHIM9254-2 <i>(Practice of natural products chemistry</i>), CHIM9269 <i>(Catalysis</i>) and MICA0008 <i>(Flavour analysis</i>). The successful candidate will also be involved in the supervision of the European Master in Biological and Chemical Engineering for a Sustainable Bioeconomy (<i>BIOCEB</i> ) and the international university  European Hub for Essential Oils (EOHUB) certificate. On a more occasional basis, the candidate may back-up the teaching team for Bachelorâs chemistry courses (e.g.: practical part of the CHIM9255 course).</p><p><u>Research Activities</u></p><p>Research activities focus on green chemistry and more particularly the exploitation of primary metabolites by innovative processes for the production of energy, biofuels, energy carriers, new materials, and molecules. This platform is part of ULIEGEâs âlocomotive themesâ in connection with the Strategic Innovation Areas as validated by the Walloon Government. In addition to primary plant metabolites, numerous uses of which are mentioned above, plants are also an under-exploited source of secondary metabolites, the structural diversity of which opens up equally diverse fields of application. Of these, their use in agronomy meets a strong societal expectation to replace conventional phytosanitary treatments based on chemical synthesis from fossil resources with bio-based products, particularly plant-based products, or new agricultural practices. Secondary plant metabolites, either through their direct biocidal activities, through the stimulation of natural plant defences (e.g. elicitation), or through chemical communication mechanisms (e.g. allelopathy) meet these expectations. Prior to the rational use of these primary and secondary plant metabolites, a detailed characterisation of the plant resource is essential. This is the context for this permanent scientific position.</p><p>The successful candidate will be expected to carry out specific innovative research aimed at developing intelligent monitoring of metabolites in the broad sense (whether primary or secondary) contained in plant resources in relation to the above-mentioned non-food applications. </p><p><u>Services to the Community</u></p><p>Community activities include facilitating the scientific aspects associated with setting up a collaborative, unique and synergistic facility to enable the characterisation and monitoring of molecules contained in plant resources with a view to their subsequent use by various teams associated with the<i> FoodIsLife, AgricultureIsLife</i> and <i>ForestIsLife </i>Research and Teaching Support Units (CAREs). This support structure will be integrated into the infrastructure of the <i>TERRA</i> Research Unit. The successful candidate will also be involved at the faculty level in activities to promote courses to secondary school pupils and Bachelorâs students looking to study for a Masterâs degree at Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech (secondary schools, student fairs, open days, etc.).</p><p>Other community service activities will be determined in consultation with senior staff.</p><h4>Qualifications required / profile</h4><ul><li>Must hold a first degree in agronomic engineering (or chemistry and bioindustries, or be a bioengineer), a Masterâs in chemical sciences, or an equivalent university Masterâs degree, and should also hold a research Doctorate with experience in the relevant area;</li><li>Must demonstrate recognised scientific experience, both in the field and through publications at international level in the relevant field;</li><li>Must be open-minded to the international world (having completed a scientific stay abroad of at least six months is an advantage);</li><li>Must be a good teacher (teaching experience is an advantage);</li><li>Must demonstrate the ability to work on interdisciplinary themes;</li><li>Must be able to work independently and within a team, using pooled human and material resources within the GxABT facilities, and must have excellent organisational and coordination skills;</li><li>Must be available for a variety of different roles relating to services to the community and public education;</li><li>Master French and English (including writing);</li><li>Must be available for missions abroad;</li><li>Must subscribe to the general quality objectives developed by the University and the faculty;</li><li>Upon appointment, the post holder must sign an agreement on the ownership of any research results.</li></ul><h4>Selection procedure</h4><p>An ad hoc Faculty committee will select the candidates to be interviewed, giving reasons for its decisions in the light of the call for applications and the candidates' qualifications and merits.

Thousands of hectares of diseased trees have had to be felled in recent years. When it comes to reforesting these areas, questions arise as to how to optimise the ways in which they are composed and managed. At the same time, forests in the tropics are being affected by global change. Their surface area is shrinking, and the landscape is becoming fragmented, mainly due to agricultural conversion and charcoal production. Tree mortality rates are increasing due to increased seasonality and large fauna are disappearing due to poaching. The way in which they function is being disrupted, their role as a carbon sink is diminishing and zoonotic diseases are increasing. Given the many ecosystem services provided by these ecosystems, close monitoring of their biodiversity and health status, in relation to human and animal health, is necessary. This monitoring should be based on networks of field-based approaches. It must also use efficient tools to document threats and deal with them quickly. This notion of âhealthâ should be considered in a broad sense and from the perspective of maintaining ecosystem services over the long term.</p><p><u>Teaching activities</u></p><p>The successful candidate will support teaching at GxABT, both in the Bachelorâs degree (courses in <i>Forest Ecosystem Management, Biosphere, Agriculture, Society, Current Environmental Issues</i>) and in the Masterâs degree in Bioengineering in Forest and Natural Area Management (modules on <i>Forest Health, Tropical Forestry, Silviculture</i>) They will also support teaching of the interfaculty Masterâs âOne Healthâ degree (ecosystems part).</p><p><u>Research Activities</u></p><p>The <i>Forest is Life</i> research and teaching support unit (CARE) has a unique wildlife monitoring network, both in Wallonia and in Central Africa. It also houses a very high resolution remote sensing platform. The scientists involved in the CARE have a wide range of skills and integrating these skills into research would enable the design of effective monitoring systems for intact and damaged forests, plantations, urban forests and agroforests. The successful candidate will be able to analyse this monitoring data to design (1) preventive management methods adapted to the threats and crises facing temperate and tropical (agro)forestry systems and (2) crisis management systems based on innovative real-time information transmission tools. </p><p><u>Services to the Community</u></p><p>Due to issues currently being addressed (deforestation, degradation, climate impacts, etc.) and the geographical scope, the successful candidate will be able to make a useful contribution to the following dynamics and structures within the University: <i>Viva Science, Green Office, Pacodel, Open Science</i>, and with regard to the faculty themes of sustainable campus and international mobility.

The institute represents an enthusiastic, dynamic and international working environment. It offers an interdisciplinary Master programme in Environmental Sciences (MUSE) with a track on Energy to which the successful candidate will contribute. </p><p><strong>Project and job description:</strong></p><p>Climate and energy policy play key roles in the European Unionâs energy and climate policy, in Switzerlandâs Energy Strategy 2050 and in the energy plans prepared by Swiss cantons. Buildings and transport are among the largest sources of CO2, causing more than half of all Swiss greenhouse gas emissions. Further important sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Switzerland are the production of industrial goods, agriculture and other sectors (e.g. waste management). The emissions caused by all these sectors and activities need to be drastically reduced at an unprecedented rate, resulting in net zero emissions by 2050. </p><p>The 2050Today initiative deals with the drastic reduction of CO2 emissions in international Geneva, the so-called 2050Today community (<a href=\"https://2050today.org/2050today-members/\" target=\"_blank\">https://2050today.org/2050today-members/</a>). In first instance, the project aims to accelerate decarbonisation by providing practical guidance and carbon footprint analysis based on accompanying research linked to M.Sc. programmes at University of Geneva. The development of joint multi-stakeholders projects to reduce CO2 emissions will be key to enhance further initial endeavours. </p><p>The post-doc position associated with the 2050Today initiative deals with organisation, science-based advice and encouragement related to carbon footprinting and LCA in international Geneva. The post-doctoral researcher will be in charge of data collection, modelling, carbon footprint assessment, interpretation and communication, thereby collaborating with a project group including representatives of UN member States, international organisations, civil society entities, local authorities, students and researchers. The post-doc will help to guide and further develop the activities of 2050Today, to strengthen the relationships with its members and widely communicate its activities (also in the form of scientific publications).</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><p>The position offers unique opportunities to the successful candidates to further develop a wide range of analytic and modelling skills, presentation and reporting skills and networking in a cutting-edge R&amp;D areas that are essential for the energy transition, nationally and internationally. Candidates should have a Masterâs degree respectively in physics, engineering or environmental sciences and they must be able to combine thorough technical understanding with economic assessment and broader aspects of the energy transition. Good knowledge of English is a necessity and good knowledge of French and/or German is a clear advantage.</p><p>The requirements for the post-doc position associated with the 2050Today initiative are: approximately five years or more of experience as consultant and researcher on practical case studies related to carbon footprinting and LCA, ability and interest to simultaneously conduct several projects, experience in project execution and project management as well as enthusiasm to support international organisations in Geneva and to guide students. In addition to English, a good command of French is required.</p><p><strong>Conditions of employment:</strong></p><p>We offer an initial 1-year appointment with planned further extension by at least three further years.

Laboratory of Excellence (LabEx) proposes a 2-year post-doctoral position starting on <strong>September the 1st 2022</strong>  to participate in research related to small body populations focused particularly on applying (and developping) advanced data processing tools to access the faint signals from TNO satellites. Observations will utilize mainly SPHERE and JWST. The objective of our this project is the study of TNOs which are tracers of the formation and evolution of planetary systems: they have a privileged link with planetary migration, and the origins of pre-biotic materials on Earth, and their dispersion in the solar system. Finally, the study of TNOs will bring direct constraints on the gaseous composition of protoplanetary disks which will be studied in parallel in our team. The net salary (+social benefits) will depend on experience. A â¬3,000 annual package for travels and equipment will be allotted.</p><p><strong><u>Research project (1/2 page â 1 page)</u></strong></p><p>The past history of the solar system - dynamical, physical and chemical - is literally inscribed in the very diverse characteristics of TransNeptunian Objects (TNOs). In a broad stroke, TNOsâ properties can trace not only the protoplanetary disk and the outcomes of planetary migrations, but also formation mechanisms and evolutionary processes. The largest objects or dwarf planets, like Pluto or Eris, are known to have satellites. However, the vast majority of TNOs remains too faint to detect a satellite that would allow to measure the mass, hence the density, of these systems. This is a critical gap in our knowledge of icy objects, since there is compelling evidence that TNOsâ bulk composition and density closely resembles that of the planet precursors or embryos. In addition, as parents of other small body populations such as comets, TNOs hold crucial clues to the distribution of prebiotic material and water in the solar system, and their delivery to Earth and other bodies in the solar system. Finally, studying TNOs can bring direct constraints on the gas composition of protoplanetary disks.</p><p>Ground- and space-based observations of TNOs have reached the limits of current telescope capacities about a decade ago. Efforts to trace water ice and to detect and characterize  complex organics in the solar system have always failed to include data in the outer regions, because of the limited sensitivity of the instrumentation. JWST offers the unrivaled opportunity to further advance our knowledge of the early stages of planetary systems. AurÃ©lie Guilbert-Lepooutre is involved in JWST observations dedicated to constraining the surface composition of large and mid-sized TNOs, as PI of a guaranteed program, as well as Co-I of an accepted large program. These unique new observations for a sample of 50-80 objects will start in 2022. To form a meaningful dataset on the core properties of TNOs, and to disentangle their primordial properties from the ones modified through evolution, we thus need to constrain the bulk density of these objects.</p><p>The SPHERE planet imaging instrument (High Contrast Spectro-Polarimeter dedicated to the Research of Exoplanets) has allowed a revolution in our vision of the external parts of exoplanetary systems and of the physical properties of giant planets. The whole design of the SPHERE instrument, in which Maud Langlois participated (as Instrument scientist and Co-I of the large exoplanets survey), was based on the need to obtain the highest possible contrast in the immediate environment of the star by the combination of different advanced techniques: adaptive optics extreme, coronography, polarimetry and differential imaging and data processing. These techniques make it possible not only to discover but also to characterize exoplanets and circumstellar environments. With this instrument, excellent contrasts can be achieved (10^-5) even at small (&lt;200 mas) separation, allowing the study of planets and circumstellar discs in a separation range that was previously inaccessible. This unique capacity can be extended to planetology. We have already started various programs with SPHERE in planetology requiring appulses, with several collaborators (Centaur Chariklo and its ring, comet 288P, dwarf planet 2015 RR245) and obtained new asteroidâs satellite detection (, proving that SPHERE can be used for TNO studies. However, the faint signals from TNO satellites are very challenging to detect and will also largely benefit from recent advances in data processing as demonstrated by new satellite detection orbiting the asteroid Elektra by our team (Berdeu 2022, 2021). TNO observations with SPHERE and JWST will benefit from recent developments in image processing made by our team (PIC (Berdeu+2020), Polarimetry (Denneulin+2021). The first step is to apply these new methods to archive data, which will allow, by improving the contrast, to perform the deepest possible search in existing data so to enhance the scientific outcomes. Improvements and new methods in data processing will then be proposed in the âplanetologyâ context, in order to add advanced processing capacity to multi-wavelengths, polarimetric and multi-epoch imaging. </p><p><strong><u>Research field(s)</u></strong></p><p>Transneptunian objects, high contrast imaging, spectroscopy, data sciences</p><p><strong><u>Supervisors and contact</u></strong></p><p>Name: Maud Langlois (DR CNRS) &amp; AurÃ©lie Guilbert-Lepoutre (CR CNRS)</p><p>Laboratory: CRAL &amp; LGL TPE</p><p>Email: maud.langlois@univ-lyon1.fr &amp; aurelie.guilbert-lepoutre@univ-lyon1.fr</p><p><strong><u>Working environment</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Job location and description</u></strong></p><p>The postdoc position aims to 1- revisit these observations and all existing archival SPHERE TNO data (about a dozen objects) by using new data analysis techniques developed by our team, 2- apply the new data analysis techniques to JWST Data 3- detect, characterize and fit the orbit of TNO satellites and surrounding material like rings, 4- estimate the mass of the systems, 5- use publicly available sizes from Spitzer and Herschel programs to derive the density of the TNOs primaries themselves, which is critical to constrain the formation and the evolution of these systems</p><p><strong><u>The Team</u></strong></p><p>We propose to build an âinterdisciplinaryâ team between astrophysics and geology. The supervisors are experts in different disciplines including observational astronomy, exoplanets, data analysis and planetology, and members of two different laboratories of the LIO, the CRAL and the LGL TPE. The main objective of our this project is the study of TNOs which are tracers of the formation and evolution of planetary systems: they have a privileged link with planetary migration, and the origins of pre-biotic materials on Earth, and their dispersion in the solar system. Finally, the study of TNOs will bring direct constraints on the gaseous composition of protoplanetary disks which will be studied in parallel in our team as part of the ANR DDISK (PI Langlois 2021-2024). Thanks to the developments in data processing together with unique access to JWST and SPHERE data and a deep knowledge of theses instruments, our team will be at the forefront to apply for telescope time to obtain complementary data on TNOs. In parallel, our team will work on numerical modeling to predic/confirm the physical characteristics of TNOs, in direct link with upcoming JWST observations. Ultimately, this study is a unique and novel step forward to better understand the formation of planetary systems, including the solar system.</p><p><strong><u>Allocated resources (technical facilites, computingâ¦)</u></strong></p><p><span style=\"color:black;\">The Computing infrastructure (</span>50-core server equipped with 500 Go RAM)<span style=\"color:black;\"> will include software environment to handle the data processing </span>and is supported by the ANR DDISK project. </p><p><strong><u>Recent publications of the team</u></strong></p><ol><li>MÃ©tayer, Guilbert-Lepoutre, Ferruit et al.

As we continue to develop new generation of CMOS neural probes (www.neuropixels.org) with higher channel densities and with the capability of recording from over 10,000 neurons, signal data processing and data transmission are becoming important hardware bottlenecks. In the project âERC-Intranet of Neurons,â our research team aims to develop an energy-efficient minimally-invasive wireless telemetry system capable of transferring the recording data from up to 10,000 recording channels, while keeping high fidelity. Direct transmission of this raw data will require a telemetry system with up to Gbps of speed, which will consume high energy and dissipate excessive heating. Hence, hardware efficient data-encoding and compression methods will be the key to reduce the transmission energy and efficiently utilize limited communication channel capacity. </p><p>In this postdoc project, novel neuro-inspired neural signal sampling/encoding methodologies will be investigated and developed. The balance between compression ratio and signal quality, and the impact on the advanced spike processing (e.g. principal component analysis) will be evaluated. These developed methodologies will be co-implemented and integrated into an ASIC and hardware system in collaboration with other researchers.

Grain and agroforestry legume crops have major unrealised potential for climate-smart transformation of nutritional, income, sustainability and resilience outcomes from smallholder systems in SSA. The LEG4DEV project is led by the National University of Ireland Galway (NUI Galway), in partnership with Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR), University of Hohenheim, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). LEG4DEVâs research and innovation activities are focused on Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. We are seeking a talented and motivated researcher to join the LEG4DEV project as a PhD student at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, University Hohenheim to conduct innovative research on assessing the resilience of legume-maize or legume-cassava intercrops under climate change conditions through process orientated modelling approaches. While most past research has been done to explore the adaptation of monocropping systems to different agro-ecological conditions and climate change not much is known for legume based inter- or relay-cropping systems. Additionally, not many crop models are capable of dealing with such integrated cropping systems. The work thus includes a meta-analysis on existing legume-maize/cassava intercrop experimental data and existing modelling approaches and concepts. Subsequently, existing legume-maize or legume-cassava intercrops datasets from our partners (CYMMIT, ILRI, IITA, Wageningen, Uppsala) across different agro-ecologies and/or different contrasting seasons would be used to calibrate and validate a chosen model(s) (incl. our own developed model, LUCIA, <a href=\"https://lucia.uni-hohenheim.de%29/\" target=\"_blank\">lucia.uni-hohenheim.de)</a>. Using existing climate change predictions for suitable East-Africa regions growth and soil fertility responses to altered temperature and rainfall conditions would be simulated and uncertainties estimated to test the robustness of intercrops under changing conditions. We are particularly interested in applications from talented and motivated researchers with strong backgrounds in at least one of the fields of agronomy, crop science, soil fertility, climate change, and a strong interest in soil-crop modelling. The successful applicant will have good mathematical and computing skills and be willing to actively interact and collect necessary data with our international partners.

This is a gold mine that is currently investigated to understand earthquake processes and their origin. Many information and models have already been extracted, such as the so-called Gutenberg-Richter law which states that the probability of an earthquake, P(M&gt;M0), of a given energy, M, follows an exponential law such that log(P(M&gt;M0))=-bM+a. The slope of this law, called \"b-value\", is investigated to produce seismic hazard maps which are used for building construction. As a result, a wrong estimation of this parameter can have catastrophic human and economic consequences. The way it is currently estimated relies on strong <i>a priori</i> choices and neglects time variations even though we know they exist1. In that context we have developed a Bayesian approach able to detect spatial and time variations of the \"b-value\" avoiding these strong <i>a priori</i> assumptions and which properly estimates the uncertainties on the inferred parameters.</p><p>In addition, physicists also study earthquake processes through experimental apparatus and physical approach, trying to link earthquake origin to physical parameters in a well constrained environment. The group of E. Bayart (LPENSL) focuses on ruptures propagation along a highly confined gouge layer2 thanks to a setup that they developed and which enables the detection of smaller ruptures preceding and succeeding a main event. In parallel, the group of O. Ramos (ILM) developed an experimental system able to reproduce in details and with millions of events, the main statistical relations describing seismicity3. </p><p>Due to the scale difference, the comparison of the rupture processes observed on natural faults and in laboratory experiments is not straight forward. Only a statistical approach can fill this gap. Therefore, the goal of this project is to link experiments and observations through a novel Bayesian approach to get a physical understanding of the b-value variations.</p><p><strong>Objectives &amp; Working plan</strong></p><p>The aim of this project is thus to better understand the origin of earthquakes by applying a new statistical Bayesian methodology to both seismic data (LGL-TPE) and experimental data (LPENSL &amp; ILM) and ultimately to link observations to physical parameters. First, the aim is to investigate spatial and time variations of the \"b-value\" applying a novel Bayesian approach, from global to regional scale, using 50 years of seismicity, which has never been done before. The Bayesian approach is already successful on synthetic cases.</p><p>Second, the aim is to link these variations to physical processes by analysing experimental data with the same methodology. The experimental setup of E. Bayart and O. Ramos enable to investigate different processes of the earthquake origin and to gather experimental data for different geometries and loading configurations. While the study of E. Bayart (LPENSL) focuses on the transition from static to sliding friction, the apparatus of O. Ramos (ILM) allows to investigate steady frictional motion. </p><p>Both E. Bayart (LPENSL) and O. Ramos (ILM) have already resources and man power to perform experimental work. Therefore, the post-doctorate scholar will focus on processing datasets, coming from both seismology and physic experiments. </p><p>References</p><p>[1]Gardonio, B., Campillo, M., Marsan, D., Lecointre, A., Bouchon, M., &amp; Letort, J.

Their specificity is that they cannot have been produced by neutron-capture processes, contrary to the majority of nuclei heavier than iron. The nucleosynthesis mechanism that leads to the formation of p-nuclei is called the <strong>p-process</strong>. According to the dominant astrophysical scenario, it takes place during core-collapse supernovae, and mainly involves the photodisintegration of a seed population of nuclei originating from the neutron rich side of the stability valley. First, several neutrons are expelled by (Î³,n) reactions, but the final abundance of the different p-nuclei crucially depends on (Î³,p) and (Î³,Î±) reactions that occur in the end. They are an essential input for the nucleosynthesis calculations that aim to test different astrophysical models to reproduce the observed abundance of p-nuclei.</p><p>Globally, the p-process involves a network around 2000 nuclei and 20000 reactions, most of which cannot be measured experimentally. <strong>Nucleosynthesis calculations have to rely on theoretical calculations</strong> of cross sections based on the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. The nuclear statistical parameters that allow to perform such calculations are the optical model potentials, the level density and the gamma strength, which are themselves described by different models. <strong>Experimental data are much needed to better constrain these models</strong>. Especially, it is repeatedly mentioned in the literature that the lack of experimental knowledge on the alpha-nucleus optical potential at energy of astrophysical interest (namely far below the Coulomb barrier) hinders the progress in the nucleosynthesis modeling. Our project is focused on the measurement of cross sections that are crucial to improve the knowledge of astrophysical reaction rates. </p><p>We have selected several key reactions for this purpose. The main objective of our project is to perform <strong>alpha and proton capture experiments at the NFS-SPIRAL2 facility</strong>, whose high-intensity alpha and proton beams in the relevant energy range offers a unique opportunity to access the very low cross sections that are needed in the astrophysical context. These measurements will involve two types of techniques: if the lifetime of the reaction product allows, the well-known <strong>activation</strong> technique can be used ; else, <strong>in-beam</strong> techniques have to be employed to count the gamma rays produced instantaneously after the reaction. We plan to perform such experiments around 2023. Meanwhile, <strong>preparatory experiments</strong> should be performed at medium-scale facilities, to better control the classical experimental issues before facing the new challenges associated with very high intensity. Furthermore, the knowledge of alpha-nucleus optical potentials also need to be increased by <strong>complementary alpha-scattering measurements</strong>: the exploration of isotopic and deformation effects should be particularly enlightening, and several such measurements will take place in the next years, for instance at the Orsay Split-Pole facility.</p><p><strong><u>Research field(s)</u></strong></p><p>Experimental nuclear astrophysics / p-process nucleosynthesis</p><p><strong><u>Supervisor and contact</u></strong></p><p><a href=\"mailto:c.ducoin@ipnl.in2p3.fr\">C.Ducoin</a></p><p>Institut de Physique des 2 Infinis de Lyon</p><p>Campus LyonTech la Doua, bÃ¢timent Dirac</p><p>4 rue Enrico Fermi, 69622 Villeurbanne</p><p>France</p><p>TEL: +33 (0)4 72 43 13 41</p><p>c.ducoin@ipnl.in2p3.fr</p><p><a href=\"mailto:o.stezowski@ip2i.in2p3.fr\">O.StÃ©zowski</a></p><p>Institut de Physique des 2 Infinis de Lyon</p><p>Campus LyonTech la Doua, bÃ¢timent Dirac</p><p>4 rue Enrico Fermi, 69622 Villeurbanne</p><p>France</p><p>TEL: +33 (0)4 72 43 13 46</p><p>o.stezowski@ip2i.in2p3.fr</p><p><strong><u>Working environment</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Job location and description</u></strong></p><p>Most of the <strong>work is performed</strong> in the <a href=\"https://www.ip2i.in2p3.fr/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>IP2I Laboratory</strong></a> and consists in conducting an <strong>experimental research program</strong> using <strong>international infrastructures</strong>. </p><p>The recruited <strong>candidate</strong> will have the <strong>charge</strong> to <strong>develop our p-process program</strong> and thus she/he will <strong>have to manage</strong> the <strong>experiments</strong> already <strong>accepted</strong> and the ones <strong>to be proposed</strong>.

In addition, the group is involved in the upgrade of CMS detector for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC, starting in 2027).

The IP2I has important responsibilities in the production and assembly of the future tracker endcaps (called TEDD detector). The construction of the TEDD mechanical structures (so-called âDeesâ) and their integration at IP2I will be performed in the next years within the LIO Clean room. These operations comprise Dee production, Dee mechanical and thermal qualification, the mounting of the silicon detector modules onto the Dees and a battery of detector module tests. The two last operations are called the âintegration phaseâ (2023-2025). The successful applicant is expected to make strong contributions to the teamâs activities in the tracker integration, especially the preparation and running of cold tests after mounting modules in the Clean room. The Post-doc tasks will consist in finalizing the development of the setup (data acquisition, control system) and performing statistical analyses.

To understand the concepts by which the brain operates, large-scale in-vivo sensing of neuron populations has emerged as a key research technique. Microfabricated silicon neural probes have been established as the dominant technology in this field and have reached ever increasing densities and numbers of simultaneous recording electrodes. Thanks to the rapid development of CMOS technology, imec has recently demonstrated a state-of-the-art active microelectrode array with up to 1000 channels, which enables neurologists and researchers to monitor the brainâs electrical activity in great detail.</p><p>Despite this great progress in neuroscience tools, major bottlenecks to further increase the channel density in CMOS neural probes are the data-transmission bandwidth and the power consumption required to transmit the large amount of raw data. While for some applications access to raw data is an important requirement, brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs) and other clinical applications only require specific information about spike events and their features. By taking advantage of this characteristic, it is possible to think of a new generation of neural probes that are able to record from 1 million neurons at once and only send out the relevant information by exploiting online hardware spike detection and/or data compression.</p><p>In this project, several online spike-detection and data-compression techniques will be explored in order to implement the most hardware-efficient integrated circuit for the detection and feature extraction of overlapping spikes in real time and with low latency. The circuits and algorithms must be area and power efficient to be implemented on chip and must achieve a considerable reduction of the data rates while maintaining the signal fidelity. The main goal is then to integrate massive multi-channel feature extraction algorithms on chip that enable clinical translation of next-generation neural probes.</p><p>This is a multi-disciplinary project that requires interest and expertise in several domains:</p><ul><li>Digital and analog/mixed-signal IC design</li><li>Understanding of BCI theory</li><li>Neural signal processing and spike sorting algorithms</li><li>Data compression algorithms</li><li>Artificial neural networks</li></ul><p>Type of work: Signal processing and analysis, IC prototype design and simulation, system integration and evaluation.</p><h2>What we do for you</h2><p>We offer you the opportunity to join one of the worldâs premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium.

Interaction design systems are today an essential part of interaction design practice that allow efficient and consistent design across large organisation or communities by defining reusable design components and patterns. Current design systems practice is expanding as diverse interaction technologies such as 3D audio, multiscreen, gestures, eye-tracking, mixed reality and haptics that are embedded in peopleâs social and physical contexts. As this trend continues it is important that we learn how to integrate such embodied and multimodal expressions into usable design systems for design practitioners. As such there is a need to experiment with and investigate frameworks allowing the definition of extended modalities and distributed interaction into design systems in interaction design practice.</p><p>The doctorate will explore the integration of post-screen interaction technologies into design systems, to realise user-friendly and aesthetically rich user experiences. The PhD should be positioned within interaction design practice with an emphasis on doing design experiments and analysis of design cases as part of the work. The project will use OpenBridge design system (<a href=\"http://www.openbridge.no/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.openbridge.no</u></a>) and connected resources as a case in the research with the purpose of improving the system as well as developing state of the art knowledge of interaction design systems practice.</p><p>The cases in this doctorate will be done in collaboration with the researchers, student assistants and designers in Ocean Industries Concept Lab, a leading design research group in Norway. The group has dedicated lab and workshop spaces. The PhD will also draw from several ongoing research projects connected to the OpenBridge design System that is dealing with advanced design systems, design in virtual and augmented reality interfaces. OpenBridge is the worldâs only open-source design system for safety critical maritime workplaces. It is currently expanded to address multiscreen, gestural, voice, eye-tracking and haptic interaction. The system is in use all over the world and is currently disrupting maritime design. The research group has wide access to leading industry actors and potential field study sites. This PhD position will be supported by our experience and offer a space for inquiry where design practice is paramount in generating actual impact for this major and changing sector of global transport and communication.</p><p>For more information on this research program, please visit <a href=\"http://www.ahophdlive.com/interaction-design\" target=\"_blank\"><u>www.ahophdlive.com. </u></a></p><h3>OpenBridge Design System</h3><p>The video shows work from the augmented reality part of OpenBridge Design System.</p><ul><li>Read more about the lab <a href=\"https://medium.com/ocean-industries-concept-lab/ocean-industries-concept-lab-6a123531f931\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a></li><li>See more work from the lab <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCefJp_IkaIggYvqArLE7QuA\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a></li></ul><h2>About the candidate</h2><p><strong>Formal requirements </strong></p><ul><li>The candidate should have a masterâs degree in interaction design.

in Designing for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) that extend early investment in expensive hardware and claims to customization and tailoring of products and artifacts to affordable and accessible practices of designing. Where DIY 3D-printing has emerged in popular and consumer culture, internationally little research has been done (outside engineering domains) into ongoing dynamics of working with artisanal expertise paths and performances into and through AM tools and platforms. Consequently, there is a dearth of design-centered studies of how these technologies may be understood in wider arguments for the transformative potential of product design in the context of post-industrial economies. This extends to related making, exchange and evaluation of what may be termed a mode of collaborative digital artisanry in the context of designing for long term sustainable futures.</p><p>This PhD will focus on Designing for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM). Currently, this is still about designing for different technologies, topology optimization and material handling. A smaller portion is about artisan work, unique artifacts and bespoke products. There is still a lack of knowledge as to how the holistic product development process might be envisaged, co-created, implemented and assessed. This PhD will therefore need to address matters of such developmental expertise in AM and Product Design and its place in the onlysignificant model of design-based AM (AICE Model developed at AHO and circulated internationally). The applicant will need to use this model and resituate it with respect to contemporary transdisciplinary research in the context technical change with respect to the Internet of Things (IoT) and socio-technical artifact production and circulation in new models of use. The candidate is invited to critically elaborate on how research in AM can contribute to more sustainable New Product Development models and practices, with attention to key aspects of designing in AM (e.g. recyclable materials, just-in-time co creation, modes of optimization-customisation). AM will need to be situated within critical perspectives on the circular economy, drawing on literatures on critical theories of technology, post-industrial collaborative manufacturing approaches, and new material-re-use relations. The goal of the research should be an advancement of methods, tools and approaches developed both by the AHO research environment, the applicant and with regard to international inquiry into AM.</p><p>The candidate should define one or more research questions relating to their practice regarding DFAM. This should be clearly located within a developmental and professional setting in which actual and conceptual results will be delivered, assessed and shared with practice and research communities. The applicant will need to propose pragmatic cases using key research-by-design methodologies, including the AHO published approach to AM that seeks to involve practitioners in developing research in the service of their ongoing practice. The PhD will address key potentials and actual practices identified and developed collaboratively with industry partners. Together, these aspects will form a vital move to shift current models and approaches to AM towards a high value with re-use and just-in-time sustainable tailoring to need and context in collaborative future NPD development processes. The cases will inform theory, enrich practice, support design education at masterâs levels and provide grist for needed policy shifts around materials and technological product consumption use and re-use for sustainable durative futures. Hence, the methodology will be based on cases from existing and possible research partners. </p><p>The candidate will engage in research through work in practice, using studio projects, required collaborations with the industry and through self-driven research by design activities. This work will be carried out within the AHO PhD program, with the aim to develop the candidateâs practice-based creative work through designedly approaches. The selected candidate will be supervised by a team led by a main supervisor at the Institute for Design at AHO. This team will combine practice and academic expertise, and will support the definition of the theoretical framework and demarcation of cases devised by the candidate, the domain area specialists at AHO and close collaboration with industry informants and partners. </p><p>AHO seeks a qualified practitioner who is engaged in processes and outcomes centered on creatively designing for AM to contribute to changing understandings of product-technology-use and related societal practices. The outcome will be an academic doctorate in which creative, critical and collaborative practice is prominent. </p><p>The study will be practice based in character and take the form of a thesis-by-compilation to make strategic contributions to excellence in design research internationally. The practice aspect of the connected study will inform the reappraisal of the AICE model and contribute to ongoing inquiry by senior researchers at the Institute of Design. This will entail relating value from creative practice to the giving of form to concepts and designs. Such connections will need to be situated within and contribute to critical assessments of emerging and project approaches to DFAM in contexts of societal technological applications and long-term sustainable futures. These are ones in which the ongoing negotiation of NPD is an essential, difficult and needed âadditiveâ concern for Design. This matters in relations between the contexts and emergent and changing political economies of production and consumption, through informing practices of participative reflexive uptake of applied technologies and by way of processes and policies of re-use in NPD. This PhD will contribute to the terms of novelty, via collaboration and through excellence in making with analysis, thereby aligning with AHOâs expressed strategic goals.</p><h2>About the candidate</h2><p><strong>Formal requirements </strong></p><ul><li>The candidate must hold a masterâs degree; In design or another relevant field that supports the proposed research.</li><li>Relevant practise from product development process using AM technology as production method.</li><li>Applicants who do not have English or a Scandinavian language as their mother tongue must submit attested documentation of their proficiency in English by the deadline of the application (TOEFL test or similar).

For example, smart electronic textiles require new features and battery designs that traditional battery technologies simply cannot provide. This has opened the door to innovation and added a new dimension to the global competition in battery research.1,2 The potential sector that can be impacted includes Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare (skin patches, medical sensors, medical diagnostic devices), smart cards, etc. To date, the soft microbattery technology is still in its infancy because it requires the pooling of complementary knowledges in different scientific domains. Indeed, key competences in microelectronics, materials science, electrochemistry, polymer, and inorganic chemistry have to be gathered to overcome all technical challenges. This is a new hot topic with strong potential impacts in the future. Recently, we have reported a new concept for the development of stretchable Li-ion microbatteries.3-5 A prototype has been integrated in a scleral eye contact lens 6,7 and several on-going projects involving big groups like SAMSUNG and THALES have been launched to fabricate functional and autonomous devices for IoT and medical applications.</i></p><p><i>The postdoctoral fellow will have to investigate new tracks to optimize the fabrication process and achieve the integration of the micropower sources for practical applications. Strong and recognized expertise in the field of batteries (electrode fabrication, assembling and testing) and materials sciences (characterization techniques) are required. Skills in microelectronics will be asset but is not requested.</i></p><p><i><strong>Environment:</strong> The research activities of Flexible Electronics Department are dedicated to the development of technological bricks adapted to the achievement of flexible or/and stretchable electronic components for applications in smart electronics (human machine interface, IoT, smart sensing, bio robotic/mimeticâ¦ Fabrication of autonomous, thin, flexible and conformable devices spread the research from nanomaterials, energy harvesting and storage to heterogeneous integration on flexible/stretchable substrates. The project will take benefit of microfabrication and characterization facilities made available by the 660m2 clean room and the technological platform âMicroPackSâ. </i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/research/scientific-departments/flexible-electronics-department-fel/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/research/scientific-departments/flexible-e</i><span style=\"color:windowtext;\"><i>lectronics-department-fel/</i></span></a></p><p><i><strong>Application:</strong> send a short CV (max. 2 pages), the list of publications, and two recommendation letters to thierry.djenizian@emse.fr</i></p><p><i><strong>Starting date:</strong> from March 2022</i></p><p><i><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 to 30 months</i></p><p><i><strong>Gross salary:</strong></i></p><ul><li><i>3080 â¬/month for less than 3 years of experience</i></li><li><i>3213 â¬/month for more than 3 years of experience</i></li></ul><p><i><strong>Recent articles published by the group:</strong></i></p><ol><li><i>S.

The lab is looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to join the team and lead the next step in our research.</p><p>Our lab significantly contributed to understanding how tissue mechanics and physiology integrate within cells. Dr. Dupont spearheaded the discovery that YAP/TAZ proteins respond to the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells, and how this pathway regulates homeostasis and cancer development in the mouse liver (Dupont Nature 2011; Aragona Cell 2013; Pocaterra J Hepatology 2019; Pocaterra CommsBio 2021). More recently we discovered how mechanical cues profoundly shape cell metabolism and contribute to cancer cell metastatic dissemination (Romani Nature Cell Biology 2019; Romani NatRevMolCellBiol 2020; Romani Nature Cell Biology in press; Dupont and Wickstrom NatRevGen under review). Dr. Dupont has been recently awarded as Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher in 2021. The current aim of the lab is understanding how cancer cell mechanics regulates key cell processes and metabolic pathways, and the importance of such regulation for therapy.</p><p>Lab website: <a href=\"https://www.medicinamolecolare.unipd.it/labdupont\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.medicinamolecolare.unipd.it/labdupont</a> </p><p>Lab publications: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/sirio.dupont.1/bibliography/public/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/sirio.dupont.1/bibliography/public/</a></p><p>Lab account on Twitter: @SirioDupont</p><p>Project:</p><p>How the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment regulate metabolism, and how this impact metastatic cancer cell response to treatment.</p><p>Among the many factors that influence cancer cell growth and response to therapy, a powerful but still poorly investigated one are the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment. Many studies have concentrated so far on the notion that primary breast cancer growth entails the stiffening and remodeling of the collagenous ECM to drive cell proliferation and invasiveness. However, when cancer cells disseminate to distant organs they almost invariably find themselves in very soft tissue environments (brain, bone marrow, lung, liver), and what are the effects of such âmechanical transitionâ remains poorly understood. This is particularly important in light of the notion that the primary cause of cancer-associated death in patients is metastasis, not primary tumor growth. The objectives of the study are to study how cancer cell signaling and metabolism are rewired in response to such âmechanical transitionâ, including the underlying mechanotransduction molecular mechanisms. A primary goal is to identify metabolic traits bestowed on cells by the mechanical microenvironment that can be used as liabilities to develop new therapy approaches aimed at eradicating disseminated dormant cancer cells, and thus potentially preventing metastatic relapse.</p><p>Fellowship:</p><p>The Postdoctoral position is opened immediately and will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found. The position if for three years, with a one-year starting contract and a two-year extension already covered by available grants (Worldwide Cancer Research, Italian Association for Cancer Research). The net salary is equivalent to that of an Italian entry-level Assistant Professor, and adequate to comfortably support a foreign worker in Italy. Fellows will be encouraged to apply for competitive National and International Fellowships (e.g. Marie Curie), as well as to young investigators grants towards scientific independence (e.g. University of Padua STARS Grant).</p><p>Responsibilities:</p><p>The Postdoctoral Fellow will work independently on their research project, but in close collaboration with other team members. The Fellow will have close interactions and exchanges with the PI to ensure a timely and efficient progression of the project, including peer-reviewed publication.</p><p>Profile:</p><p>The applicant should have a PhD (or should obtain a PhD within the first months of year 2022) in biological, biotechnology or pharmaceutical sciences. They should have a strong background in cell culture, imaging techniques and basic molecular biology. They are expected to have a passion for science and are motivated to work on a highly innovative project in an open and dynamic team. Previous experience in metabolism studies and/or a certificate of experimentation on laboratory animals is a plus but is not required. The ability to write and speak in English is mandatory. Good communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a team are required. Priority will be given to candidates with a proven record of scientific publication (published or under review) in international peer-reviewed journals.</p><p>Techniques used in the lab:</p><p>Cell culture on micropatterned surfaces and hydrogels with controlled mechanical properties, conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy, high throughput/high content image analyses, Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), gene expression analysis, metabolic analyses, RNAi and CRISPR/CAS9 loss-of-function approaches, in vivo metastasis assays with Bioluminescent Intravital Imaging, multiplexed automated IF analyses of cancer tissues.</p><p>Environment:</p><p>We are a growing laboratory, and we are seeking for highly motivated individuals to push forward the next step in our research. We have several projects ongoing with the possibility of immediate contribution. We have an extensive network of National and International collaborations providing us with state-of-the art experimental techniques and approaches.

Forecasts. It is an intergovernmental organisation created in 1975 by a group of European nations and is today supported by 34 Member and Co-operating States, mostly in Europe. The Centreâs mission is to serve and support its Member and Co-operating States and the wider community by developing and providing world-leading global numerical weather prediction. ECMWF functions as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions and holds one of the largest meteorological archives in the world. The success of its activities relies primarily on the talent of its scientists, strong partnerships with its Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning across its operations. </p><p>Over the years, ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union, and for the past seven years has been an entrusted entity for the implementation and operation of the Climate Change and the Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the EU's Copernicus component of its Space Programme, as well as a contributor to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The collaboration does not stop there and includes other areas of work, including High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend its provision of data and products covering weather, climate, air quality, fire and flood prediction and monitoring.</p><p>ECMWF has recently become a multi-site organisation, with its headquarters based since its creation in Reading, UK, its new data centre in Bologna, Italy, and new offices in Bonn, Germany.</p><p>It has also adopted a hybrid organisation model which allows its staff to mix both office working and teleworking. This generous and flexible model provides our staff with considerable flexibility to spend time outside or away from their duty station and decide how they wish to manage their professional working time at ECMWF. ECMWF is an organisation that values the whole being and both understands and values the need for flexibility in the way its staff work.</p><p>For additional details, see www.ecmwf.int</p><h2>About DestinE</h2><p>ECMWF will be a major partner in the implementation of the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative starting later in 2021, together with ESA and EUMETSAT as partners. The objective of the European Commission DestinE initiative is to deploy several highly accurate thematic digital replicas of the Earth, called Digital Twins.  The Digital Twins will help monitor and predict environmental change and human impact, in order to develop and test scenarios that would support sustainable development and corresponding European policies for the Green Deal. </p><p>DestinE will thus contribute to revolutionising the European capability to monitor and predict our changing planet, complementing existing national and European efforts such as those provided by the national meteorological services and the Copernicus Services. It will be run in several phases, of which the first, the implementation phase, covers the period end-2021 â mid-2024. Future phases are foreseen (subject to funding) that will operationalise the digital twins, scale-up system production and add applications and new twin options. </p><p>DestinE covers several demanding digital technology aspects required to develop, implement and operate the two high-priority digital twins on weather induced and geophysical extremes and on climate change adaptation. ECMWF will be responsible for the delivery of these digital twins, which will rely on complex Earth-system simulation models, data assimilation methods for fusing simulations and observations through inverse modelling and the integration of observations and models from sectors such as water and food management, renewable energies and socio-economic risk and disaster management. </p><p>These science components require advanced digital technology solutions to maximize the efficient computing and data handling on extreme-scale infrastructures, and to adapt and operate these infrastructures across different heterogeneous architectures within a federated framework. This federated framework includes the Core Platform and Data Lake developed, deployed and operated by ESA and EUMETSAT respectively. </p><p>The DestinE developments take forward the long-term investments of the ECMWF Member States in building a unique European prediction capability and will support the further advancement of member states services and Copernicus Services.</p><p>For more

We are looking for a motivated PhD or postdoc to join us to work on high-resolution imaging using integrated photonics.</p><p>Fluorescence microscopy is an indispensable tool in biology and medicine and has fuelled many breakthroughs in a wide set of sub-domains. The microscopes, however, are often bulky and expensive systems that require regular maintenance. Additionally, they need to strike a compromise between device size, the size of the field of view, and resolution.</p><p>The next big push in microscopy with a large societal impact will come from compact, cost-effective, and robust optical systems that will make fluorescence microscopy highly accessible. </p><p>At imec, within the framework of an ERC starting grant, we are working on facilitating this next breakthrough by introducing a novel high-resolution imaging platform based entirely on an intimate marriage of active on-chip photonics and CMOS image sensors. This concept will eliminate the necessity of standard free-space optical components by integrating specially designed structured optical illumination, illumination modulation, optical filters, and an image sensor in a single chip. The way the sample is illuminated is analogues to total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which has excellent surface sensitivity and background suppression. The resulting platform will enable high-resolution, fast, robust, zero-maintenance, and inexpensive microscopy with applications reaching from cellomics to DNA sequencing, proteomics, and highly parallelized optical biosensors.</p><p>Your primary goal is to further mature the concept and platform. Your work consists of establishing a system model including image reconstruction, the design and characterization of photonic components, and finally, proof of concept demonstrations.</p><p>The fabrication of the photonic integrated circuits will be carried out in imecâs semiconductor pilot line, and during the entire design/fabrication cycle you will closely interact with process integration engineers. The characterization will be carried out in imecâs life lab, where you will work together with an international, multidisciplinary team of PhDs and senior researchers.</p><h2>What we do for you</h2><p>We offer you the opportunity to join one of the worldâs premier research centers in nanotechnology at its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. With your talent, passion and expertise, youâll become part of a team that makes the impossible possible.

These include vascular, cardiac, respiratory and bone therapeutics (among others) as well as biofabrication techniques, like bioprinting, that are not organ specific. The therapeutic goal can be tailored to the candidates expertise and interest. </p><p>The clinical relevance of the project will be an important factor for the evaluation of the candidate. The approach can be pharmacological, based on a medical device, a cell-based therapy, or a complex construct using biofabrication methods. All these avenues are being developed in the labs that will support this position. It is also preferable to include animal models in the research program strategy. </p><p><strong>Expected competences: </strong></p><p>The candidate will have extensive expertise in either the technological or the physiological aspects relevant to the proposed research project. A strong background in cell biology and/or physiology relevant to the pathology to be explored is expected. A robust publication record will confirm the scientific productivity of the candidate. An established ability to secure funding is also expected. An international experience is necessary and ongoing international collaborations as well as a multidisciplinary experience will be seen as significant pluses. Experience in managing research (student/staff supervision) is essential. Finally, teaching experience will be an important selection criterion. </p><p><strong>Expected scientific impact: </strong></p><p>The candidate will be expected to take on various responsibilities in the lab where the research project will be developed. The candidate is expected to work with other members of the lab to develop new projects.

No person may hold more than one fixed term position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the same institution.</p><p>The position can<strong> </strong>additionally be assigned to teaching and related work for UiT in an amount equivalent to a maximum 10 % of a full-time employment.</p><p>The workplace is at UiT in TromsÃ¸<strong>.</strong> You must be able to start in the position within a reasonable time after receiving the offer.</p><p>Unless special circumstances indicate otherwise, postdoctoral projects shall be planned with stays abroad. The duration should be at least 6 months.</p><h2>Department of Medical Biology</h2><p>More than 200 staff members from all over the world have their workplace at the <a href=\"https://en.uit.no/enhet/imb?p_dimension_id=88110\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Department of Medical Biology</u></a> (IMB). The department consists of 13 research groups concentrating on fundamental biomedical research problems, including research on various cancer forms, cardiovascular diseases, the body's immune system and antibiotic resistance. The department is also involved in marine bio-prospecting and testing of new drugs.</p><p>IMB provides education for students studying medicine, dentistry, biomedical laboratory sciences, biomedicine and pharmacy.</p><p>The position is organized within the recently reappointed <a href=\"https://en.uit.no/forskning/forskningsgrupper/gruppe?p_document_id=396834\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Stem Cells, Ageing and Cancer Research Group</u></a> (SAC). The group aims at understanding malignant haematopoietic stem cell behaviour and regulation. Our goal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets of potential clinical interest. We use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including novel mouse genetic tools, stem cells, omics and advanced imaging. Our group has a broad international network and strengthens translational research through established collaborations with the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN).</p><h2>The position's field of research</h2><p>Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly aggressive haematopoietic malignancy often associated with poor response to chemotherapy and outcome. Our recent work shows that the anti-inflammatory properties of the stem cell and its niche are low in AML, and this may contribute to the origin or progression of malignancy in both in vivo models and patients. In a follow-up project, the successful candidate will contribute now to understand the molecular (genetic/epigenetic) mechanisms underlying the process of HSC malignant transformation, aiming at using this knowledge for better patient treatment. Further project details will be directly discussed with the applicants.</p><p>The successful applicant may contribute to the Department's teaching activities (up to 10% of the time). Teaching duties will be allocated based on the applicant's qualifications and the needs of the Department, and may include exam work, teaching seminars, and supervising or assisting in lab courses.</p><p>You must submit a description of your past research project(s) and its relevance to the advertised position (maximum 2 pages).</p><p>It is expected that the successful candidate shall prepare progress reports some months after commencing employment, and thereafter on a regular basis.

PhD Position in the field of turbulent reacting multi-phase flows with focus on the experimental quantification of the atomisation and evaporation process of sustainable aviation fuels by means of laser-based diagnostics and AI based data analysis. </p><p><strong>Background:</strong></p><p>The institute of combustion technology for aerospace engineering (IVLR) at the University of Stuttgart is an integrative unit of the DLR institute of combustion technology.  The institutes host approximately 80 scientists plus a number of students from various fields of specialization to address research question of modern gas turbines. Thermal conversion of sustainable energy carriers, e.g. green hydrogen, is a key element for the energy transition policy, while synthetic aviation fuels are without alternative for flights beyond mid-range distances. We support this development with the competence fields computer simulation, chemical kinetics and analytics, combustion diagnostics, mass spectrometry, multi-phase flow and high-pressure combustion. Current research topics are instationary combustion, pollutant formation, spray combustion, alternative fuels and innovative combustor systems. In this context, we target fundamental research and transfer the results to technical applications.</p><p>Your position is assigned to a DFG funded (Emmy Noether) junior research group at the IVLR, University of Stuttgart, work in close cooperation with the DLR Institute combustion technology and advance the fundamental understanding of turbulent reacting multi-phase flows to enable technology innovations. For this purpose, we utilise canonical spray and combustion configurations as well as realistic high-pressure test rigs. Laser-based diagnostics and novel data analysis methodologies are our most important tools to resolve the effects of turbulent flow on physical and chemical processes governing in spray atomisation and combustion. The acquired highly accurate data are used to advance our fundamental understanding of the involved processes, allow us to develop novel and optimised fuel injector and combustors concepts as well as validate and advance numerical models.</p><p><strong>Problem Definition:</strong></p><p>The overarching objective is the advancement of fundamental understanding of the interactions between turbulent flow, reaction chemistry and multiple phases that govern pollutant formation as well as fuel and load flexibility of combustion concepts. The acquired understanding is of paramount importance for the development of cleaner, more sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies. Nearly emission-free operation becomes feasible when used in combination with carbon-neutral synthetic liquid fuels. However, the sought flexibility and low emissions can currently not be achieved simultaneously due to the lack of suitable injection and combustion concepts.  Multi-stage liquid fuel atomisation in highly turbulent gas flow in combination with auto-ignition based combustion offers a promising concept to achieve these objectives. However, the complexity of the inherent nonlinearities and multilateral interactions on multiple scales is accompanied by a lack of quantitative data. This gap shall be closed using laser-based diagnostics in combination with a novel AI-supported data analysis concept. Your specific tasks will involve:</p><ul><li>Familiarise yourself with the topics turbulent multi-phase flows, atomization, evaporation and combustion</li><li>In the team we will develop novel laser-based diagnostics to delineate the involved processes and interactions.</li><li>Plan, conduct and lead detailed measurements on the atomisation and evaporation of sustainable aviation fuels in highly turbulent flows.</li><li>Advance the design of innovative injection concepts.</li><li>In the team we develop innovate data analysis tools to enable a quantitative description of the studied phenomena and interactions.</li><li>You analyse the data and present your work within the team, on national and international conferences as well as journal publications.</li><li>Your results will provide the fundamental understanding to develop novel injector concepts, to enhance fuel and load flexibility as well as scalability limits and reduce pollutants.</li><li>You engage and discuss your findings with various internal and external colleagues as well as national and international collaboration partners.</li></ul><h4><strong>Anforderungsprofil &amp; Qualifikationen</strong></h4><p><strong>Your Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Completed academic university degree (MSc. / university diploma), e.g. in aerospace engineering, engineering, physical chemistry or comparable subject</li><li>Determination, commitment and enthusiasm</li><li>Innovation capability, open-mindedness and good comprehension</li><li>Independence and team work within and outside our group</li><li>Strong background in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics</li><li>Basic knowledge of multi-phase flows (sprays) and combustion</li><li>Experience with programming languages (e.g. Python) is advantageous</li><li>Experience with laser-based diagnostic is desirable</li><li>Fluent in written and spoken English</li><li>Knowledge of the German language is beneficial</li></ul><p><strong>We offer:</strong></p><ul><li>Salary grade E13 TV-L 100%</li><li>Excellent opportunity to conduct a PhD (fully funded)</li><li>You will be part of a young and highly motivated team that is an integrative subdivision of a very experienced and interdisciplinary research department</li><li>Focus on fundamental research with a simultaneous high exposure to technical application within the department</li><li>Collaboration with leading national and international research labs</li><li>Interdisciplinary, independent and diversified research tasks</li><li>A stepping stone for a leadership career in industry and research</li><li>Possibility to participate in national and international conferences and workshops</li><li>Access to an extensive professional development programme</li></ul><p><strong>You Are interested?</strong></p><p>Then we look forward to receiving your application!</p><p>Please send your comprehensive application via Email to fabian.hampp@ivlr.uni-stuttgart.de by the latest the 20.02.2022.

It is an intergovernmental organisation created in 1975 by a group of European nations and is today supported by 34 Member and Co-operating States, mostly in Europe. The Centreâs mission is to serve and support its Member and Co-operating States and the wider community by developing and providing world-leading global numerical weather prediction. ECMWF functions as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions and holds one of the largest meteorological archives in the world. The success of its activities relies primarily on the talent of its scientists, strong partnerships with its Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning across its operations.</p><p>Over the years, ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union, and for the past seven years has been an entrusted entity for the implementation and operation of the Climate and the Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the EU's Copernicus component of its Space Programme, as well as a contributor to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The collaboration does not stop there and includes other areas of work, including High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend its provision of data and products covering weather, climate, air quality, fire and flood prediction and monitoring.</p><p>ECMWF has recently become a multi-site organisation, with its headquarters based since its creation in Reading, UK, its new data centre in Bologna, Italy, and new offices in Bonn, Germany.</p><p>The Computing Department is responsible for the strategy, design and 24/7 service provision of ECMWFâs mission-critical ICT infrastructure and services. State-of-the-art high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, storage solutions to support the worldâs largest meteorological data archive and ICT solutions for the organisation are core of the Departmentâs mission.</p><p>More than 60 technical and engineering staff, located in Reading and Bologna, provide ICT services and support to users of the ECMWF Departments of Research, Forecasts, Copernicus and Administration, as well as ECMWFâs external users in Member States and Co-operating States.</p><p>The Computing Department actively researches the technology landscape for the benefit

ECMWF functions as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions and holds one of the largest meteorological archives in the world. The success of its activities relies primarily on the talent of its scientists, strong partnerships with its Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning across its operations. </p><p>Over the years, ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union, and for the past seven years has been an entrusted entity for the implementation and operation of the Climate Change and the Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the EU's Copernicus component of its Space Programme, as well as a contributor to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The collaboration does not stop there and includes other areas of work, including High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend its provision of data and products covering weather, climate, air quality, fire and flood prediction and monitoring.</p><p>ECMWF will be a major partner in the implementation of the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative, together with ESA and EUMETSAT as partners. The objective of the European Commission DestinE initiative is to deploy several highly accurate thematic digital replicas of the Earth, called Digital Twins, to monitor and predict natural and human activities as well as their interactions, to develop and test scenarios that would enable more sustainable developments and support corresponding European policies for the Green Deal. </p><p>ECMWF has recently become a multi-site organisation, with its headquarters based since its creation in Reading, UK, its new data centre in Bologna, Italy, and new offices in Bonn, Germany.</p><p>It has also recently adopted a hybrid organisation model which allows its staff to mix both office working and teleworking. This generous and flexible model provides our staff with considerable flexibility to spend time outside or away from their duty station and decide how they wish to manage their professional working time at ECMWF. ECMWF is an organisation that values the whole being and both understands and values the need for flexibility in the way its staff work.</p><p>For additional details, see www.ecmwf.int.</p><h2>About DEEP-SEA and EUPEX projects</h2><p>DEEP-SEA and EUPEX are two EuroHPC projects both concerned with the advancement of European HPC infrastructure.</p><p>DEEP-SEA aims to demonstrate the benefits of the Modular Supercomputing Architecture concept which was developed in the previous DEEP, DEEP-ER and DEEP-EST EU projects. Its focus is on the development and validation of an open-source programming environment appropriate for MSA machines. A selection of HPC applications has been chosen to co-design and validate the programming environment on the MSA prototype platform assembled in the DEEP-EST project.</p><p>The EUPEX consortium is designing, building, and validating the first HPC platform integrating the upcoming European general-purpose processor (EPI), European interconnect technology (BXI), and an MSA-enabled European software stack for HPC. EUPEX will encompass everything from hardware architecture and processors to system software, development tools, and HPC user applications. The EUPEX software stack will comprise all necessary software components to enable the efficient exploitation of large-scale modular systems based on EPI processors. Thanks to this, the co-design applications will be able to demonstrate Exascale readiness on the EUPEX platform.</p><p><img class=\"image_resized\"

It is an intergovernmental organisation created in 1975 by a group of European nations and is today supported by 34 Member and Co-operating States, mostly in Europe. The Centreâs mission is to serve and support its Member and Co-operating States and the wider community by developing and providing world-leading global numerical weather prediction. ECMWF functions as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions and holds one of the largest meteorological archives in the world. The success of its activities relies primarily on the talent of its scientists, strong partnerships with its Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning across its operations.</p><p>Over the years, ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union, and for the past seven years has been an entrusted entity for the implementation and operation of the Climate and the Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the EU's Copernicus component of its Space Programme, as well as a contributor to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The collaboration does not stop there and includes other areas of work, including High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend its provision of data and
